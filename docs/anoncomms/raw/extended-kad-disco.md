## Abstract

This specification defines a lightweight peer discovery mechanism
built on top of the libp2p Kademlia DHT.
It allows nodes to advertise themselves by storing a new type of peer record under
their own peer ID and enables other nodes to discover peers in the network via
random walks through the DHT.
The mechanism supports capability-based filtering of `services` entries,
making it suitable for overlay networks that
require connectivity to peers offering specific protocols or features.

## Motivation

The standard libp2p Kademlia DHT provides
content routing and peer routing toward specific keys or peer IDs,
but offers limited support for general-purpose random peer discovery
— i.e. finding *any well-connected peer* in the network.

Existing alternatives such as mDNS,
Rendezvous,
or bootstrap lists do not always satisfy the needs of
large-scale decentralized overlay networks that require:

- Organic growth of connectivity without strong trust in bootstrap nodes
- Discovery of peers offering specific capabilities (e.g. protocols, bandwidth classes, service availability)
- Resilience against eclipse attacks and network partitioning
- Low overhead compared to gossip-based or pubsub-based discovery

By leveraging the already-deployed Kademlia routing table and random-walk behavior,
this document define a simple, low-cost discovery primitive that reuses existing infrastructure while adding capability advertisement and filtering via a new record type.

## Semantic

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document
are to be interpreted as described in [2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

Please refer to [libp2p Kademlia DHT specification](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/e87cb1c32a666c2229d3b9bb8f9ce1d9cfdaa8a9/kad-dht/README.md) (`Kad-DHT`)
and [extensible peer records specification](https://github.com/logos-co/logos-lips/blob/31dfa0c8c2f3e7f7365156246c4eb7b7c390e76e/vac/raw/extensible-peer-records.md) (`XPR`) for terminology used in this document.

## Protocol

### Record Propagation

A node that wants to make itself discoverable,
also known as an _advertiser_,
MUST encode its discoverable information in an [`XPR`](https://github.com/logos-co/logos-lips/blob/31dfa0c8c2f3e7f7365156246c4eb7b7c390e76e/vac/raw/extensible-peer-records.md#extensible-peer-records).
The encoded information MUST be sufficient for discoverers to connect to this advertiser.
It MAY choose to encode some or all of its capabilities (and related information)
as `services` in the `XPR`.
This will allow future discoverers to filter discovered records based on desired capabilities.

In order to advertise this record,
the advertiser SHOULD first retrieve the `k` closest peers to its own peer ID
in its own `Kad-DHT` [routing table](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/e87cb1c32a666c2229d3b9bb8f9ce1d9cfdaa8a9/kad-dht/README.md#kademlia-routing-table).
This assumes that the routing table has been previously initialised
and follows the regular [bootstrap process](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/e87cb1c32a666c2229d3b9bb8f9ce1d9cfdaa8a9/kad-dht/README.md#bootstrap-process) as per the `Kad-DHT` specification.
The advertiser SHOULD then send a `PUT_VALUE` message to these `k` peers
to store the `XPR` against its own peer ID.
This process SHOULD be repeated periodically to maintain the advertised record.
We RECOMMEND an interval of once every `30` minutes.

#### Use of `XPR` in `identify`

Advertisers SHOULD include their `XPR`s as the `signedPeerRecord`
in libp2p `Identify` [messages](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/0762325f693afb2e620d32d4f55ba962d1293ff9/identify/README.md#the-identify-message).

> **Note:** For more information, see the `identify` protocol implementations,
such as [go-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/blob/636d44e15abc7bfbd1da09cc9fef674249625ae6/p2p/protocol/identify/pb/identify.proto#L37),
as at the time of writing (Jan 2026)
the `signedPeerRecord` field extension is not yet part of any official specification.

### Record Discovery

A node that wants to discover peers to connect to,
also known as a _discoverer_,
SHOULD perform the following random walk discovery procedure (`FIND_RANDOM`):

1. Choose a random value in the `Kad-DHT` key space. (`R_KEY`).

2. Follow the `Kad-DHT` [peer routing](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/e87cb1c32a666c2229d3b9bb8f9ce1d9cfdaa8a9/kad-dht/README.md#peer-routing) algorithm,
with `R_KEY` as the target.
This procedure loops the `Kad-DHT` `FIND_NODE` procedure to the target key,
each time receiving closer peers (`closerPeers`) to the target key in response,
until no new closer peers can be found.
Since the target is random,
the discoverer SHOULD consider each _previously unseen_ peer in each response's `closerPeers` field,
as a randomly discovered node of potential interest.
The discoverer MUST keep track of such peers as `discoveredPeer`s.

3. For each `discoveredPeer`, attempt to retrieve a corresponding `XPR`.
This can be done in one of two ways:

    3.1 If the `discoveredPeer` in the response contains at least one multiaddress in the `addrs` field,
    attempt a connection to that peer and wait to receive the `XPR` as part of the [`identify` procedure](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/e87cb1c32a666c2229d3b9bb8f9ce1d9cfdaa8a9/identify/README.md).

    3.2 If the `discoveredPeer` does not include `addrs` information,
    or the connection attempt to included `addrs` fails,
    or more service information is required before a connection can be attempted,
    MAY perform a [value retrieval](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/e87cb1c32a666c2229d3b9bb8f9ce1d9cfdaa8a9/kad-dht/README.md#value-retrieval) procedure to the `discoveredPeer` ID.

4. For each retrieved `XPR`, validate the signature against the peer ID.
In addition, the discoverer MAY filter discovered peers
based on the capabilities encoded within the `services` field of the `XPR`.
The discoverer SHOULD ignore (and disconnect, if already connected) discovered peers
with invalid `XPR`s
or that do not advertise the `services` of interest to the discoverer.

### Privacy Enhancements

To prevent network topology mapping and eclipse attacks,
`Kad-DHT` nodes MUST NOT disclose connection type in [response messages](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/e87cb1c32a666c2229d3b9bb8f9ce1d9cfdaa8a9/kad-dht/README.md#rpc-messages).
The `connection` field of every `Peer` MUST always be set to `NOT_CONNECTED`.

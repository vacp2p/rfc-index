## Abstract

This document defines a generic/pluggable component for selecting a Mix path and lists the path selection strategies that a mix user/application/service can select based on their anonymity and communication requirements. 

The default Mix Protocol selects a fresh random path for every message. This provides strong route diversity against a global passive adversary, but can result in a high probability of selecting a fully malicious path when a communication session requires a large number of Mix packets.

This specification introduces a generic path-selection interface and defines three path-selection modes:
  
- **Random mode:** intended for short or unrelated communication where paths are sampled independently.
- **Session mode:** intended for sessions that may generate many (related) Mix packets, such as anonymous downloads.
- **Time-based mode:** intended for long-lived identities or services that communicate over many sessions and potentially with many anonymous clients, such as hidden services.

The strategies specified here build on previous research on [path selection strategies for anonymous download](https://forum.research.logos.co/t/mix-path-selection/721) and [hidden services](https://forum.research.logos.co/t/hidden-service-time-based-path-selection/730/1)

## Definitions

### mixnet adversaries
In order to decide which path selection strategy is needed for a specific use-case, we need to define the threat model. Mixnets in general are designed to provide anonymity and protect against "Global Passive Adversaries" (GPA) which can observe all traffic on the network. To help achieve this, mixnets select a path (of `L` hops) uniformly at random from the set of online mix nodes. While this minimizes how much the GPA can observe, it doesn't account for the fact that most network traffic consists of sessions rather than single packets. 

In a session, the two communicating parties will exchange multiple packets and for each one, they will select a path. If we assume a percentage of the network is controlled by malicious mix nodes (e.g., 10%), then the more packets needed for a session, the more chance that a path containing all malicious nodes is possible. Therefore, if traffic is expected to consist of sessions (e.g., anonymous download and hidden services), then we need to consider the malicious mix node adversary in our threat model. We can refer to this adversary as MMN.

With these two adversaries (GPA and MMN), we need to balance how much advantage we give to each:
- selecting paths uniformly at random minimizes the advantage given to GPA and maximizes it to MMN. 
- selecting a single path for the whole session (similar to Tor) maximizes advantage for GPA and minimizes it for MMN.

### the de-anonymization likelihood metric (`DLM`)
The path selection modes specified in this document will try to balance the advantages given to each of these adversaries. The metric we use to measure the expected anonymity provided by each mode is the de-anonymization likelihood metric (`DLM`). This metric was introduced in the [NDSS paper](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2026-f2384-paper.pdf) and we use it with some slight modifications. Let's start with some notation:
- $L$ is the number of mix nodes in a path.
- $\mathcal{M}$ is the set of online mix nodes.
- $m=|\mathcal{M}|$ is the number of online mix nodes.
- $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{M}$ is the set of malicious nodes.
- $a=|\mathcal{A}|$ is the number of malicious nodes.
- $\beta=a/m$ is the malicious fraction of the network.
- $q$ is the probability that one sampled path is fully compromised.

For a free-route mixnet that samples $L$ distinct nodes uniformly at random, we can calculate this as:

$$
q = \beta^L.
$$

Given these notations, we can now define **DLM** as:
the de-anonymization likelihood metric that estimates the probability of picking a fully malicious path (a path of `L` nodes that are all malicious). Depending on the use-case, DLM can be calculated differently. We consider the three main formulas:
- packet-based DLM (P-DLM): the probability of selecting a malicious path with `L` hops from the set of online mix nodes $\mathcal{M}$ where we expect $\beta$ percentage of them to be malicious:

    $$
    \texttt{P-DLM}=q = \beta^L
    $$

    For example, if the adversary controls $10\%$ of the nodes and paths contain three independently selected hops, then

    $$
    \texttt{P-DLM}=0.1^3=0.001
    $$

    Thus, approximately one out of every 1000 independently sampled paths is expected to be fully compromised.

- session-based DLM (S-DLM): the probability that at least one packet in a session uses a fully compromised path.
    Consider a session containing $N$ packets. If the path used by each packet is selected independently and every path has compromise probability $q$, the probability that none of the packets uses a fully compromised path is:

    $$
    (1-q)^N
    $$

    The probability that at least one packet uses a fully compromised path is therefore:

    $$
    \texttt{S-DLM}(N) = 1-(1-q)^N = 1-\left(1-\beta^L\right)^N
    $$

    e.g., for a 2 KB packet payload and one return path per packet, a 4 MB transfer needs approx $N=4096$ paths (ignoring acks and redundancy, etc). With $\beta=0.1$, $L=3$:

    $$
    \texttt{S-DLM}(4096)\approx 98\%.
    $$

    Note: this formula assumes that packet paths are independent. We will need to adjust it later for strategies that reuse paths, fixes hops, or selects hops from a set with differnt $\beta$ values.

- time-based DLM (T-DLM): extends S-DLM to a long-lived hidden service exposed to repeated requests from malicious clients. To get an approximation for T-DLM, we can restrict the lifetime of the hidden service to $T$ and work out a formula for computing T-DLM. We can basically compute this using the same $\texttt{S-DLM}$ formula above but compute $N$ based on how many path need to be selected over the service lifetime $T$.


### Path selection strategy
A **path-selection strategy** is a method for constructing a Mix path from the currently eligible Mix nodes. A strategy may be stateless, or it may retain local state in order to reuse selected nodes across multiple path requests. Path-selection state is local to the initiating node and is not part of the path or Sphinx packet encoding.

## Path selection as a generic pluggable component

Path selection can be treated as an optional pluggable component with the default being random selection. Instead of Sphinx construction embedding the path selection into its internal function, it requests a path from a configured `PathSelector`. Different `PathSelector`-s can be chosen based on the anonymity and communication requirements and assumptions about the mixnet. 

The selector type and selector state are local to the initiating node and don't change the encoding of Sphinx packets. A selected path is passed to the existing Sphinx packet-construction procedure defined by the Mix Protocol.

The path selector can be initialized using a config that is `PathSelector`-specific along with the mix node pool manager which the selector can use when selecting paths:

```
type PathSelector* = ref object of RootObj
    nodePool: MixNodePool
    config: PathSelectorConfig
    rng: CSPRNG
```

The config would contain params that are needed for initializing the path selector. The `PathSelector` interface API should expose path selection and return the resulting mix path which will be passed to the normal Sphinx packet-construction procedure.

Path selection might require applying some constraints such as fixing some exit hops and excluding the destination from the path. This is especially needed since forward, cover, and surb paths are constructed differently. In general, the path selection function can be abstracted as follows:

```

PathConstraints {
    excludedNodeIds: Set<NodeId>
    fixedHops: Map<HopIndex, MixNode>
}

SelectPath(
    nodePool: MixNodePool
    constraints: PathConstraints
    ...
) -> MixPath
```

Mix requires three path types, and different types result in different strategies and path structures:

```
PathPurpose =
    FORWARD
    SURB
    COVER
```

### forward packets (`FORWARD`)

For forward packets:

```text
purpose = FORWARD
pathLength = L
excludedNodeIds = { destinationId }
```

The selector chooses all L hops. The node at index L - 1 is the exit. A caller can then encode the final destination after that exit. If the exit is the destination, then it can be added to the list of fixed hops as a path selection constraint. 

```
fixedHops[L-1] = destinationId
```

### SURB return path (`SURB`)

For a SURB created by the original initiating node:

~~~text
purpose = SURB
pathLength = L
excludedNodeIds = {
    InitiatorId,
    forwardExitId,
    forwardDestinationId
}
fixedHops[L - 1] = InitiatorId
~~~

The selector fills L - 1 positions and the return path terminates at the initiator. `forwardExitId` is the exit node that will receive the SURBs (or forward the SURBs to the destination). `forwardDestinationId` is the destination node for the forward message, this could also be the same node as the `forwardExitId` when the exit is the destination. 

### Cover loop (`COVER`)

For a cover packet that returns to its origin:

~~~text
purpose = COVER
pathLength = L
excludedNodeIds = { InitiatorId }
fixedHops[L - 1] = InitiatorId
~~~

The selector fills L - 1 positions. Cover traffic path loops back to the initiator as specified in the [mix cover traffic specification](https://lip.logos.co/anoncomms/raw/mix-cover-traffic.html). Additionally, cover traffic path selection does not require a specified strategy and can fall back to uniform random selection of mix nodes.


### Path validity

The Path selector must validate/ensure the selected path satisfies all of the following:

1. it contains exactly L nodes and satisfies the minimum and maximum supported by the Mix Protocol.
2. every node in the path is present in the mix node pool
3. no node identifier appears more than once.
4. Every node has the addressing and key material required for Sphinx construction.
5. The path meets the conditions defined in `PathConstraints`.

### Path Selector Types

This specification document defines three path selection strategies/modes. A higher-layer protocol may select one of the following:

```text
PathSelectorType =
    RANDOM
    SESSION
    TIME_BASED
```

The selector type determines the lifetime of the path-selection strategy.

| Selector | lifetime | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| `RANDOM` | One packet | unrelated or short messages |
| `SESSION` | One logical session | anonymous download |
| `TIME_BASED` | Multiple sessions within time `T` | hidden service |

Defining when a session/service starts and ends is done when initializing the path selector. Each selector defines its own initialization interface and `PathSelectorConfig`. Further details are provided in the following sections.

## Random Path Selection (`RANDOM`)

The random selector follows the current Mix Protocol path-selection behavior. For every path-selection request:

1. obtain the set of eligible live Mix nodes
2. place all `F` caller-fixed hops from `PathConstraints`
3. select $L-F$ distinct nodes uniformly at random excluding the nodes from the `exclusionList` and the `fixedNodes`
4. order the selected nodes randomly
5. return the resulting path

No state is maintained between requests. Every packet therefore receives an independently selected path.

For an adversary controlling fraction $\beta$ of the eligible Mix pool, the probability that one $L$-hop path is fully malicious is approximately

$$
q \approx \beta^L
$$

This is the probability that only a single packet will be de-anonymized. However, if the node sends single packets over time, after $N$ independently selected paths, the probability that at least one fully malicious path is selected is approximately:

$$
\texttt{S-DLM}_{\mathrm{Random}}(N)
\approx
1-(1-\beta^L)^N
$$

This is the probability that a user should expect for one of its packets to be deanonymized. The packets do not necessarily need to be sent at the same time and can be separated over time. Random selection provides the highest route diversity among the strategies defined in this document but causes the number of independent malicious-path opportunities to grow with the number of packets.

## Session-Based Path Selection (`SESSION`)

The session selector is intended for applications that generate many logically related Mix packets during a bounded period.

Examples include:

- anonymous downloads
- anonymous uploads
- large request/response exchanges implemented using the Mix transport layer.

The session selector combines fixed-hop selection (similar to the K-HF in the [research post](https://forum.research.logos.co/t/mix-path-selection/721)) with ordered K-sized sets (i.e., the K/W strategy). It follows the fixed-hop approach because fixing one or more hop positions limits the number of opportunities for a session to encounter a fully malicious path. The K-sized sets allow the selector to tolerate realistic node churn without sampling a new node whenever the active fixed node is temporarily unavailable. The set also helps to set an upperbound on the deanonymization probability that we can tolerate, and the session would only be valid as long as we don't exceed this set. 

`SessionSelector` can be created at the beginning of the session:

```text
SessionSelector.init(
    config: SessionSelectorConfig,
) -> SessionSelector
```

A distinct session-selector instance must be initialized for each independent session. However, all forward packets, control packets, acknowledgements, and SURBs belonging to the same session must use the same selector instance. The selector instance must be discarded when the session ends and must not be reused by an unrelated session. This prevents the path-selection layer itself from introducing linkability between otherwise independent sessions, although initializing more independent selectors also increases the node's cumulative exposure to new candidates.

### Path selection algorithm
The session-based path selection algorithm takes the following inputs, which can be set as configuration parameters:
- The number of hops in the path: `L`
- The number of fixed hops: `F`
- The size of the set for each fixed hop: `K`

Algorithm steps:

#### 1. Initialize fixed sets
For each fixed position $j \in \{0..F\}$, the selector samples an ordered set of $K$ distinct candidates:

$$
S_j=(n_{j,1},n_{j,2},\ldots,n_{j,K}).
$$

The first candidate $n_{j,1}$ is initially active. The selector stores the candidate sets and active indices in the selector state:

```text
SessionState {
    candidateSets
    activeCandidateIndex
}
```
#### 2. Path construction
For each path request, the selector:

1. places the active candidate for each fixed position into the path
2. If any of the active candidates are offline, replace it with the next available candidate in the candidate set. If none are available, return an error.
3. samples every non-fixed position without replacement from the current eligible Mix pool.
4. excludes all nodes already placed in the path.
5. returns the resulting valid path.

Example with path length $L=3$, fixed position 1, and candidate set for position 1 is $(A,B,C)$:

```text
packet 1: A -> X -> Y
packet 2: A -> D -> E
packet 3: B -> F -> G   // A unavailabl, B becomes active
packet 4: A -> H -> I  // A is back online
```

The active candidate is only rotated when it is unavailable. When it is back online, it will be the active candidate again. If none of the candidates are online for any of the hop $K$ nodes in the set then the session should ends to preserve the anonymity requirement as specified when constructing the path selector. 

#### De-anonymization probability

Let $h_f$ be the number of fixed positions and let $\beta_f$ be the estimated malicious fraction in the pool from which fixed-hop candidates are selected. If no fallback is activated, the approximate session de-anonymization likelihood for $N$ paths is

$$
\texttt{S-DLM}_{\mathrm{Session}}(N)
\approx
\beta_f^{h_f}
\left(
1-
\left(1-\beta^{L-h_f}\right)^N
\right)
$$

where $\beta$ is the estimated malicious fraction for the remaining positions. For sufficiently large $N$, this approaches $\beta_f^{h_f}$.

Because we are using the fixed-hop candidate sets for each hop, we can estimate the upper bound for the `DLM` value we expect with this path selection strategy:

$$
\texttt{S-DLM}_{\mathrm{Session}}(N)
\lesssim
\left(1-(1-\beta_f)^K\right)^F
\left(
1-
\left(1-\beta^{L-F}\right)^N
\right)
$$

This formula is a bit conservative for the probability that a session encounters at least one fully malicious path. It has two parts:

$$
\underbrace{\left(1-(1-\beta_f)^K\right)^F}_{\text{malicious candidates in all fixed-hop sets}}
\quad
\underbrace{\left(1-\left(1-\beta^{L-F}\right)^N\right)}_{\text{fully malicious random hops at least once}}
$$

This upper bound is a bit pessimistic because just having a malicious node in a candidate set does not mean that node will become active. This bound assumes that churn or adversarial behavior can eventually cause a malicious candidate in every set to be selected. That assumption might be unrealistic in some cases and nodes in these fixed positions are most likely chosen from a pool of stable/trusted nodes, but it helps to set an upper bound. Realistically, the expected `DLM` is somewhere between the above two formulas.

### Session anonymity profiles
To simplify the anonymity requirement, we can structure it as multiple anonymity profiles. A user can select one of three profiles when initializing the session selector:

```text
SessionProfile =
    LITE
  | STANDARD
  | STRICT
```

- `LITE` favors path diversity and availability by fixing fewer hops and having large candidate sets. It is the least likely to interrupt a session because of unavailable candidates.
- `STANDARD` is the default profile and balances path diversity, availability, and exposure to candidates.
- `STRICT` prioritizes anonymity and limiting exposure to new nodes/candidates at the cost of lower path diversity and a greater chance that the session might end when candidates are unavailable.

Each profile normatively determines:

- the path length $L$
- the number of fixed hop positions $F$
- the ordered candidate-set size $K$
- the liveness, recovery, and what happens when the candidate set is all offline.

The recommended concrete values for these profiles are listed below with estimates of the de-anonymization probability for each profile. 

Profile | $L$ | $F$ | $K$ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `LITE` | 3 | 1 | 5 |
| `STANDARD` | 3 | 2 | 5 |
| `STRICT` | 4 | 3 | 3 |

All three profiles use the same policy:

1. each ordered candidate set is initialized once when the session selector is created
2. the selector doesn't extend, replace, or reorder a candidate set during the session
3. for every path request, the selector chooses the first currently eligible candidate in the set's original order
4. if an earlier candidate becomes eligible again after a backup candidate was used, the earlier candidate regains priority.
5. if no candidate is eligible/online at any of the fixed positions, then path selection fails and the session aborts.

Assuming $\beta_f=0.1$ and $N = \infty$, the resulting probability of de-anonymization for each profile are:

| Profile | $\texttt{S-DLM}_{\mathrm{Session}}$ | $\texttt{S-DLM}_{\mathrm{Session}}$ upper bound |
|---|---:|---:|
| `LITE` | 0.1 = 10% | 0.41 = 41% |
| `STANDARD` | 0.01 = 1% | 0.17 = 17% |
| `STRICT` | 0.001 = 0.1% | 0.02 = 2% |


## Time-based Path Selection (`TIME_BASED`)

Time-based selection extends selector state across application sessions and possibly across multiple time epochs. Its intended use includes long-lived anonymous identities or services.

The time-based selector defined here maintains a fixed, sparse topology of Mix nodes and a smaller set of active complete paths within that topology. The topology uses a set of somewhat trusted and high-bandwidth nodes possibly supplied by the service which limits cumulative exposure to new nodes. Active paths provide route diversity without independently rotating individual nodes and exposing arbitrary new combinations.

A distinct selector instance is initialized for each long-lived service identity:

```text
TimeBasedSelector.init(
    profile: TimeBasedProfile,
    expiresAt: Timestamp,
    nodePool: MixNodePool,
    rng: CSPRNG
) -> TimeBasedSelector
```

The selector state is shared by all application sessions and path requests associated with that service identity. It must not be shared by unrelated identities. `expiresAt` defines the end of the period $T$ for which the selector is valid. The selector takes a set of mix nodes `MixNodePool` which could be provided by the service or randomly selected from the mix network. The pool must be large enough to fill the fixed topology. 

### Parameters

Let:

- $L$ be the number of consecutive path positions controlled by the time-based selector
- $K$ be the number of candidate nodes in each topology layer;
- $d$ be the out-degree and in-degree between consecutive layers
- $M$ be the number of active complete paths
- $\mathcal{P}$ be the set of complete paths allowed by the fixed topology with size $R=|\mathcal{P}|$
- $r_i$ the rotation time for path $i$ in $\mathcal{P}$

For the fixed topology:

$$
R=K \cdot d^{L-1}
$$

### Topology initialization

When initialized, the selector:

1. obtains the currently eligible nodes from `MixNodePool`
2. samples $L$ disjoint layer sets $S_1,\ldots,S_L$, each containing $K$ distinct nodes
3. constructs a degree-$d$ topology by connecting every pair of consecutive layers
4. enumerates the possible complete paths $\mathcal{P}$ through that topology
5. samples $M$ distinct active paths uniformly without replacement from $\mathcal{P}$
6. assigns every active path an independent rotation time $r_i$.

A node identifier appears in at most one topology layer. The selector must enforce the general path validity and supplied constraint rules. The topology construction must give each node exactly $d$ outgoing edges to the next layer and exactly $d$ incoming edges from the previous layer. An example fixed topology is shown below:

```
               Fixed 5-5-5 topology, degree d=2

      L1                    L2                    L3

     [A1] ───────────────► [B1] ───────────────► [C1]
       └─────────────────► [B2] ───────────────► [C2]

     [A2] ───────────────► [B2] ───────────────► [C2]
       └─────────────────► [B3] ───────────────► [C3]

     [A3] ───────────────► [B3] ───────────────► [C3]
       └─────────────────► [B4] ───────────────► [C4]

     [A4] ───────────────► [B4] ───────────────► [C4]
       └─────────────────► [B5] ───────────────► [C5]

     [A5] ───────────────► [B5] ───────────────► [C5]
       └─────────────────► [B1] ───────────────► [C1]
```

### Path rotation

Every active path has its own independent duration

$$
\tau=\max(X_1,X_2),
\qquad
X_1,X_2\sim U(r_{min},r_{max})\text{ hours}
$$

Based on simulation the recommended rotation values for a lifetime of less than 30 days:

$$
r_{min} = 1 \qquad r_{max} = 48
$$

When an active path expires, the selector:

1. removes that complete path from the active set
2. samples one replacement path uniformly from the set $\mathcal{P}$ excluding nodes that are not already active
3. assigns the replacement a newly sampled independent rotation time.

Note: The topology and its nodes remain the same after an active path expires and a previously chosen path may be selected again after expiry since selection is random and the set $\mathcal{P}$ is expected to be smaller in size than the expected number of paths requested.

### Path selection

For every path request, the selector:

1. applies `PathConstraints` and removes any active path that does not satisfy them.
2. removes any active path containing a node that is currently offline or unavailable.
3. samples uniformly from the remaining active paths.
4. add any additional hops, e.g. a requested exist node.
5. returns the selected path.

Temporary unavailability should not cause path rotation. If no active path is usable, depending on the availability requirement, the selection fails or an additional path is sampled from the fixed topology and added to the set $\mathcal{P}$. 

### Time-based anonymity profiles

To simplify the parameters for services/applications, we can define three profiles:

```text
TimeBasedProfile =
    LITE
  | STANDARD
  | STRICT
```

Each profile determines $L$, $K$, $d$, $M$, and the rotation values $r_{min}$ and $r_{max}$

Profile | $L$ | $K$ | $d$ | $M$ | num of paths $R$ | Path rotation |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `LITE` | 3 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 45 | $\max(X_1,X_2)$, $X_i\sim U(1,48\text{ h})$ |
| `STANDARD` | 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 135 | $\max(X_1,X_2)$, $X_i\sim U(1,48\text{ h})$ |
| `STRICT` | 4 | 5 | 2 | 5 | 40 | $\max(X_1,X_2)$, $X_i\sim U(1,48\text{ h})$ |

- `LITE` uses three fixed topology layers and degree 3.
- `STANDARD` is the recommended default. Its four fixed layers lower the fully malicious-path probability, while degree 3 gives more route diversity.
- `STRICT` keeps the four fixed layers but reduces the degree to 2. It allows fewer routes in exchange for the lowest expected T-DLM.

Simulations with malicious control $\beta=0.10$, a 30-day hidden service lifetime, five active paths, and 20,000 trials show the following expected deanonymization probabilities:

| Profile | Sybil | Basic | APT | FVEY | Rubberhose1 | Rubberhose2 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `LITE` | 3.600% | 33.480% | 40.880% | 40.215% | 33.760% | 24.830% |
| `STANDARD` | 0.620% | 19.960% | 36.670% | 39.245% | 17.880% | 7.350% |
| `STRICT` | 0.320% | 17.980% | 36.900% | 37.090% | 16.930% | 6.690% |

where we define these threat models as follows:

| Model | behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `Sybil` | Sybil a percentage $\beta$ of the mix nodes |
| `basic` | 50% chance of compromise within 15 days, otherwise never |
| `APT` | 75% within 15 days and 100% by 30 days |
| `FVEY` | 50% within 2 days, 75% within 7 days, otherwise never |
| `rubberhose1` | 50% between 2 and 14 days, otherwise never |
| `rubberhose2` | 50% between 7 and 21 days, otherwise never

## Security Consideration

- The strategies proposed in this document do not define how a node pool establishes that a candidate is trustworthy. Constructing a pool of trusted nodes depends on each service and can be specified in a separate specification document.
- Both session- and time-based selection strategies reduce cumulative exposure within a bounded session or time $T$. However, running multiple sessions and operating multiple hidden service instances would increase the probability of deanonymization. 
- Path constraints need to be handled carefully so as not to introduce/help adversary with confirmation attacks, i.e., confirming certain mix nodes are used within the fixed paths. 
- Repeated use of fixed paths may allow nodes on these paths to infer that they belong to some fixed path. The degree of certainty depends on multiple factors, including traffic volume, path reuse, mixing delays, and the cover-traffic strategy. Further research is required to determine whether this creates a practical side channel.
- Concentrating traffic on a small set of fixed nodes may increase load and create congestion. Nodes selected for fixed paths should provide sufficient bandwidth and are expected to tolerate rate-limit/RLN restrictions. The selector can then choose the appropriate nodes for the mix pool passed to the selector.
- Restricting traffic to a smaller set of paths may also give a global passive adversary (GPA) more opportunities to link observations over time. Mixing and cover traffic may reduce this advantage, but their effectiveness under persistent path reuse requires further research and analysis.

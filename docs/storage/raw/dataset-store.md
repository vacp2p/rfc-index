## Abstract

This specification contains the interface for a simple local storage component, named the Dataset Store, which supports Logos Storage nodes in storing and keeping track of partial and complete datasets along with their metadata on-disk, and provides basic support for dataset caching.

**Keywords.** dataset, block, dataset storage, caching, local storage, Logos Storage

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

### Interface

The interface is specified as pseudo-Python. The focus here is on primitive semantics, not code realism. In particular, we will ignore:

1. whether the operations are run synchronously or asynchronously, in a single thread or in multiple threads;
2. error conditions which are not domain specific; e.g. `IOError` does not belong here, whereas `QuotaExceededError` perhaps does. Errors are presented as exceptions, but these can be mapped into result types in languages that support or have a preference for them;
3. methods which could be present for efficiency reasons. Those can be added at the discretion of the implementor.

A DatasetStore is typically mounted on a local folder. Implementations will therefore typically provide, at its simplest:

```python
def new_dataset_store(path: Path, quota: uint): DatasetStore
  """Creates a new `DatasetStore`, which can hold up to `quota`
  bytes worth of `Datasets`."""
  ...
```

**Listing 1.** Creating a new DatasetStore.

High-level `Dataset` creation/deletion operations, as well as quota management and caching operations, are provided at the `DatasetStore` interface, shown in Listing 2. Block-level operations are provided in the `Dataset` interface, shown in Listing 3.

The `DatasetStore`/`Dataset` interfaces rely on a few external pseudotypes:

1. `BytesIO` represents a generic read or write byte stream;
2. `Bitset` is a fixed-size set - typically represented as a bit array - which encodes an integer set. Bit $i$ in this array is set to $1$ if $i$ is in the set, or $0$ otherwise;
3. `CID` represents a libp2p [Content Identifier](https://github.com/multiformats/cid);
4. `Manifest` represents a [Logos Storage Manifest](./datasets.md);
5. `Block` represents an arbitrary chunk of data;
6. `MerkleProof` represents a Merkle inclusion proof for a `Block`.

We omit the `self` parameter from all method signatures for brevity.

```python
class DatasetStore:

  def remaining() -> uint:
    """Returns the free available space in this DatasetStore, in bytes.
    This MUST be equal to the quota minus the size of all Datasets
    in this store. Partially completed Datasets MUST count with their
    full size, even if not all of the Dataset blocks are available locally.

    """Creates a new Dataset from a byte stream and stores
    it on disk. Store quota SHOULD be deducted as the stream gets

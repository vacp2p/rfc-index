# About

The Logos LIP Index collects specifications maintained by IFT-TS across Messaging, Blockchain,
and Storage. Each RFC documents a protocol, process, or system in a
consistent, reviewable format.

This site is generated with mdBook from the repository:
[vacp2p/rfc-index](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index).

## Contributing

1. Open a pull request against the repo.
2. Add or update the RFC in the appropriate component folder.
3. Include clear status and category metadata in the RFC header table.

If you are unsure where a document belongs, open an issue first and we will
help route it.

We keep RFCs in Markdown within this repository; updates happen through
pull requests.

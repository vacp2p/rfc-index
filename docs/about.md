# About

The Vac RFC Index collects specifications maintained by Vac across Waku, Nomos,
Codex, and Status. Each RFC documents a protocol, process, or system in a
consistent, reviewable format.

This site is generated with mdBook from the repository:
[vacp2p/rfc-index](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index).

## Contributing

1. Open a pull request against the repo.
2. Add or update the RFC in the appropriate project folder.
3. Include clear status and category metadata in the RFC header table.

If you are unsure where a document belongs, open an issue first and we will
help route it.

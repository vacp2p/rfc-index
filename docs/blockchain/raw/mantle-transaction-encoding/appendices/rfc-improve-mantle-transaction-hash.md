## Motivation

As Mantle Transactions grow (notably with large `CHANNEL_INSCRIBE` Operations), computing `ZkHash` over the whole transaction becomes a noticeable cost during transaction construction and verification. This RFC proposes a small change that preserves the use of `ZkHash` while reducing the amount of data hashed inside the circuit.

## Proposal

In version [[1.2.0] Mantle](../../../deprecated/v1.2.0-mantle.md), the Mantle Transaction hash is defined as the `ZkHash` of the entire Mantle Transaction, excluding the Ledger Transaction proof and the Operation proofs.
Currently we perform a zero-knowledge hashing on a Mantle Transaction (without proofs):
`tx_hash = ZkHash(mantle_tx_without_proofs)`.
However, execution of this hashing algorithm is time consuming and grows with the size of the input. Therefore, we propose instead hashing the Mantle Transaction using the classic hash defined in [[1.0.2] Common Cryptographic Components](../../common-cryptographic-components.md), then hashing the result with `ZkHash`:
`tx_hash = ZkHash(classic_hash(mantle_tx_without_proofs))`,
where `classic_hash()` is the classic hash defined in [[1.0.2] Common Cryptographic Components](../../common-cryptographic-components.md).

## Justification

The proposed change speeds up computation of the Mantle Transaction hash by moving most of the work out of `ZkHash` and into a classic hash, while still committing to the result inside `ZkHash`. This becomes an issue as Mantle Transactions grow, since hashing can take a substantial amount of time (for example, if the transaction contains a large `CHANNEL_INSCRIBE` Operation).
Here we show the difference of computation speed for Mantle Transactions encoding and hashing containing a single Ledger Transaction and a single Inscription varying the size of the inscription to make the transaction longer.

We can clearly see that combining the classic and zk hashes yields a significant improvement.

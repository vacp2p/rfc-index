# Introduction

In this document, we present the specification defining the construction of the block proposal, its validation, and execution. We define the block proposal construction that contains references to transactions (from the mempool) instead of a complete transaction to limit its length. The raw block body increases with the size of transactions it contains up to `MAX_BLOCK_SIZE`, which is 1 MB and covers the transactions only, and the proposal compresses its size down to at most ≈16.7 kB (16,747 bytes), which saves the bandwidth necessary to broadcast new blocks.

# Overview

For the consensus protocol to make progress, a new **leader** is elected through the leader lottery. The new leader is in possession of a proof of leadership (PoL) that confirms that it is indeed the leader. The main objective of the leader is to construct a new block, hence becoming a **block builder,** and share it with other members of the network as a **block proposer**. The block must be correctly constructed; otherwise, it will be rejected by the consensus nodes who are validating every block. Only validated blocks are executed, which means that the transactions included in the block are interpreted by all nodes, and the state of the chain is modified according to the instructions embedded in the transactions.

## High-level Flow

Below, we present a high-level description of the block lifecycle. The main focus of this section is to build an intuition on the block construction, validation, and execution.

1. A leader is selected. The leader becomes a block builder.
2. The block builder **constructs** a block proposal.
1. The block builder selects the latest block (parent) as the reference point for the chain state update.
2. The block builder selects valid Mantle Transactions (as defined in [Mantle](bedrock-v1.1-mantle-specification.md)) from its mempool and includes references to them in the proposal.
3. The block builder populates the block header of the block proposal.

3. The block proposer sends the block proposal to the Blend network.
4. The validators receive the block proposal.
5. The validators **validate** the block proposal.
1. They validate the block header.
2. They retrieve complete transactions from their mempool that are referred in the block.
3. They validate each transaction included in the block.

6. The validators **execute** the block proposal.
1. They derive the new blockchain state from the previous one by executing transactions as defined in [Mantle](bedrock-v1.1-mantle-specification.md).
2. They update the different variables that need to be maintained over time.
3. They execute the [**Service Reward Distribution Protocol**](bedrock-service-reward-distribution.md) to generate reward notes locally.

# Constructions

## Hash

We are using two hashing algorithms that have the same output length of 256 bits (32 bytes) that are [Poseidon2 and Blake2b](common-cryptographic-components.md).

## Block Proposal

A block proposal, instead of containing complete Mantle Transactions of an unlimited size, contains short fixed-size references to the transactions. The number of references varies from block to block, so the proposal is variable-size: 363 bytes when it references no transaction, and at most 16,747 bytes when it references the maximum of `MAX_BLOCK_TXS` transactions.

We define the following message structure:

```python
class Proposal:                              # 363..16747 bytes
    header: Header                           # 297 bytes
    references: References                   # 2..16386 bytes (2-byte count + entries)
    signature: Ed25519Signature              # 64 bytes
```

Where:

- `header` is the header of the proposal; defined below: [Header](#header).
- `references` is a variable-length list of up to `MAX_BLOCK_TXS` [references](#references) to transactions, each being a 16-byte (`REFERENCE_PREFIX_LENGTH`) prefix of the transaction hash defined in [Mantle Transaction](bedrock-v1.1-mantle-specification.md#mantle-transaction).
- `signature` is the signature of the complete `header` using the `leader_key` from the `ProofOfLeadership`; the size of the `Ed25519Signature` type is 64 bytes.

The proposal carries no padding of its own. Proposal indistinguishability is provided at the message layer: [Payload Formatting](payload-formatting.md#body) already mandates a fixed body length (`Max_Body_Length`) for every dispersed payload, with shorter messages padded with **random** data and the true length carried in `body_length`. An in-proposal zero-padded layout would duplicate that guarantee while charging every proposal the full `MAX_BLOCK_TXS` cost even when it references few transactions. The padding lies outside the signed proposal and is discarded via `body_length` on decapsulation, so no consensus meaning ever attaches to it.

Note that this makes the random-padding requirement of [Payload Formatting](payload-formatting.md#body) load-bearing for the first time. While the proposal was a constant size it always filled the body exactly and the padding path never fired for a real proposal. Implementations must pad with random data, not zeros, or the padding region will itself distinguish proposals by their reference count.

### Header

```python
class Header:                                # 297 bytes
    bedrock_version: byte                    # 1 byte
    parent_block: hash                       # 32 bytes
    slot: SlotNumber                         # 8 bytes
    block_root: hash                         # 32 bytes
    proof_of_leadership: ProofOfLeadership   # 224 bytes
```

Where:

- `bedrock_version` is the version of the proposal message structure that supports other protocols defined in linked reference; its size is 1 byte and is fixed to `0x01`.
- `parent_block` is the block ID ([Cryptarchia Protocol](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md)) of the parent block, validated and accepted by the block builder. It is used for the derivation of the `AgedLedger` and `LatestLedger` values necessary for validating the PoL; the size of the `hash` is 32 bytes.
- `slot` is the consensus slot number; the size of the `SlotNumber` type is 8 bytes.
- `block_root` is the root of the Merkle tree constructed from the **full** transaction hashes (defined in [Mantle Transaction](bedrock-v1.1-mantle-specification.md#mantle-transaction)) used for constructing the `mempool_transactions` references list; the size of the `hash` is 32 bytes. Because `block_root` commits to the full hashes, it uniquely binds the proposal to a specific ordered transaction selection even when two transactions share the same `references` prefix. It also binds the *number* of references; see [Binding of the reference list](#binding-of-the-reference-list).
- `proof_of_leadership` is the proof confirming that the sender is the leader; defined below: [Proof of Leadership](#proof-of-leadership).

### References

Each reference is a fixed-length prefix of the transaction hash rather than the full hash. The prefix length is the protocol parameter `REFERENCE_PREFIX_LENGTH = 16` bytes, and the prefix is taken by:

```python
REFERENCE_PREFIX_LENGTH = 16   # bytes

def prefix(hash_input: bytes, length: int) -> bytes:
    return hash_input[:length]
```

```python
class References:                            # 2..16386 bytes
    mempool_transactions: list[bytes]        # UINT16 count + len * REFERENCE_PREFIX_LENGTH
```

Where `mempool_transactions` is a variable-length list of up to `MAX_BLOCK_TXS` references to transactions, each being `prefix(mantle_txhash(tx), REFERENCE_PREFIX_LENGTH)` of the transaction hash defined in [Mantle Transaction](bedrock-v1.1-mantle-specification.md#mantle-transaction).

The list is not padded. As specified in [Canonical Encoding](#canonical-encoding), it is serialized as a 2-byte little-endian element count followed by that many `REFERENCE_PREFIX_LENGTH`-byte entries, so its encoded size is `2 + len(mempool_transactions) * REFERENCE_PREFIX_LENGTH` bytes — 2 bytes when the proposal references no transaction, and `2 + 1024 * 16 = 16386` bytes at `MAX_BLOCK_TXS`.

A decoder must reject a count greater than `MAX_BLOCK_TXS` **before** allocating for it or performing any mempool lookup, on every ingress path.

### Proof of Leadership

```python
class ProofOfLeadership:                     # 224 bytes
    proof: Groth16Proof                      # 128 bytes
    entropy_contribution: zkhash             # 32 bytes
    leader_key: Ed25519PublicKey             # 32 bytes
    leader_voucher: RewardVoucher            # 32 bytes
```

Where:

- `proof` is the proof confirming that the proposal is constructed by the leader; the size of the `Groth16Proof` type is 128 bytes (2 compressed $`\mathbb{G}_1`$and 1 compressed $`\mathbb{G}_2`$ BN256 elements).
- `entropy_contribution` is the output of the PoL contribution for Cryptarchia entropy; the size of the `zkhash` type is 32 bytes.
- `leader_key` is the one-time `Ed25519PublicKey` used for signing the `Proposal`. This binds the content of the proposal with the `ProofOfLeadership`; the size of the `Ed25519PublicKey` type is 32 bytes.
- `leader_voucher` is the voucher value used for retrieving the reward by the leader for proposal; the size of the `RewardVoucher` is 32 bytes.

> **Field order.** The order above is the **wire** order, i.e. the order in which these fields are concatenated by [Canonical Encoding](#canonical-encoding). The `block_id` preimage in [Cryptarchia Protocol](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#block-id) absorbs the same four fields in a *different* order (`leader_voucher`, `entropy_contribution`, `proof`, `leader_key`). This is deliberate, not an inconsistency: `block_id` is a domain-separated enumeration of header fields rather than a re-serialization of the header, so the two orders are independent and both are normative. Changing either one changes a different thing — the wire format in the first case, block identity in the second.

## Canonical Encoding

This section defines the byte-level wire format of the block proposal. It follows the same conventions as the [Mantle Transaction Encoding](mantle-transaction-encoding.md), in particular *"All multi-byte integers use little-endian encoding"* and *"Any lists are length-prefixed with fixed width uints"*, and reuses its primitive terminals rather than redefining them.

The encoding is canonical: every valid proposal has exactly one byte representation, and every byte string decodes to at most one proposal. The following rules are normative.

1. All multi-byte integers are little-endian.
2. The fields of a structure are concatenated in the order in which they are declared, with no separators, no alignment padding, and no per-field framing.
3. A list is encoded as a `UINT16` element count followed by that many elements, each encoded individually. The count must not exceed the list's declared bound.
4. Decoding must consume the input exactly. A decoder must reject input that ends before the structure is complete, and must equally reject input with bytes remaining after it. Accepting trailing bytes would allow two distinct wire messages to decode to the same proposal, which is a parser differential and therefore a consensus-split risk.

```schema
Proposal          = Header References Ed25519Signature

Header            = Version ParentBlock Slot BlockRoot ProofOfLeadership
Version           = Byte            ; fixed to 0x01
ParentBlock       = Hash32
Slot              = UINT64
BlockRoot         = Hash32

ProofOfLeadership = Groth16 EntropyContribution LeaderKey LeaderVoucher
EntropyContribution = FieldElement
LeaderKey         = Ed25519PublicKey
LeaderVoucher     = FieldElement

References        = ReferenceCount *Reference
ReferenceCount    = UINT16          ; MUST NOT exceed MAX_BLOCK_TXS
Reference         = 16BYTE          ; REFERENCE_PREFIX_LENGTH bytes
```

The terminals `Byte`, `UINT16`, `UINT64`, `Hash32`, `FieldElement`, `Groth16`, `Ed25519PublicKey` and `Ed25519Signature` are those defined in [Mantle Transaction Encoding](mantle-transaction-encoding.md#common-structures). Note in particular that `FieldElement` is a little-endian BN254 field element, which fixes the byte order of `entropy_contribution` and `leader_voucher`.

This yields the following sizes, where `n` is the number of references:

| Structure | Encoded size | Minimum | Maximum |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Header` | `1 + 32 + 8 + 32 + 224` | 297 | 297 |
| `ProofOfLeadership` | `128 + 32 + 32 + 32` | 224 | 224 |
| `References` | `2 + 16n` | 2 | 16,386 |
| `Proposal` | `297 + (2 + 16n) + 64` | 363 | 16,747 |

The maximum of 16,747 bytes is what [Payload Formatting](payload-formatting.md#body) uses as `Max_Body_Length`.

## Proposal Construction

In this section, we explain how the block proposal structure presented above is populated by the consensus leader.

The block proposal is constructed by the leader of the current slot. The node becomes a leader only after successfully generating a valid PoL for a given `(Epoch, Slot)`.

### Prerequisites

Before constructing the proposal, the block builder must:

1. Select a valid parent block referenced by `ParentBlock` on which they will extend the chain.
2. Derive the required Ledger state snapshots `AgedLedger` and `LatestLedger` from the state of the chain including the last block.
3. Select a valid unspent note winning the PoL.
4. Generate a valid PoL proving leadership eligibility for `(Epoch, Slot)` based on the selected note. Attach the PoL to a one-time Ed25519 public key used to sign the block proposal.

Only after the PoL is generated can the block proposal be constructed (see [Proof of Leadership](cryptarchia-proof-of-leadership.md)).

### Construction Procedure

1. Initialize proposal metadata with the last known state of the blockchain. Set the:
  - `header`:
    - `bedrock_version`
    - `parent_block`
    - `slot`
    - `block_root`
    - `proof_of_leadership`:
      - `leader_voucher`
      - `entropy_contribution`
      - `proof`
      - `leader_key`

2. Construct the `mempool_transactions` object:
1. Select Mantle transactions:
    - Choose up to `MAX_BLOCK_TXS` valid `SignedMantleTx` from the local mempool.
    - Ensure each transaction:
      - Is valid according to [Mantle](bedrock-v1.1-mantle-specification.md).
      - Has no conflicts with others (e.g., two transactions trying to spend the same note).

  No prefix-collision avoidance is needed at selection time. At `REFERENCE_PREFIX_LENGTH = 16` a collision between two distinct transaction hashes is infeasible to encounter or to manufacture (see [Prefix length and collision resistance](#prefix-length-and-collision-resistance)), so a 16-byte prefix identifies a transaction as unambiguously as the full hash does for reconstruction purposes.

3. Derive references values:
```python
references: list[bytes] = [prefix(mantle_txhash(tx), REFERENCE_PREFIX_LENGTH)
                           for tx in mempool_transactions]
```

4. Compute the `header.block_root` as the root of the Merkle tree constructed over the full transaction hashes of the selected transactions used to build `references`. The `references` list is left exactly as long as the selection; it is not padded.
5. Sign the block proposal header, where `header` is its canonical encoding as defined in [Canonical Encoding](#canonical-encoding) — the 297 bytes of the header alone, without `references` and without the signature itself.
```text
signature = Ed25519.sign(leader_secret_key, header)
```

6. Assemble the block proposal.
```python
proposal = Proposal(
    header,
    references,
    signature
)
```

  The PoL must have been generated beforehand and bound to the same Ledger view as mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

The constructed proposal can now be broadcast to the network for validation.

## Block Proposal Reconstruction

Given a block proposal, we assume *transaction maturity*. This means that the block proposal must include transactions from the mempool that have had enough time to spread across the network to reach all nodes. This ensures that transactions are widely known and recognized before block reconstruction.

This transaction maturity assumption holds true because the block proposal must be sent through the Blend Network before it reaches validators and can be reconstructed. The Blend Network introduces significant delay, ensuring that transactions referenced in the proposal have reached all network participants. This approach is crucial for maintaining smooth network operation and reducing the risk that proposals get rejected due to transactions being unavailable to some validators. Moreover, by increasing the number of nodes that have seen the transaction, anonymity is also enhanced as the set of nodes with the same view is larger. This may result in increased difficulty—or even practical prevention—of executing deanonymization attacks such as tagging attacks.

Upon receipt of a block proposal, validators must confirm the presence of all referenced transactions within their local mempool. This verification is an absolute requirement—if even a single referenced transaction is missing from the validator's mempool, that validator must reject the proposal. This stringent validation protocol ensures only widely-distributed transactions are included in the blockchain, safeguarding against potential network state fragmentation. The check is against a local mempool, so see [Reference Resolution](#reference-resolution) for what such a rejection does and does not establish about the block.

The process works as follows:

1. Transaction is added to the node mempool.
2. Node sends the transaction to all its neighbors.
3. Neighbors add the transaction to their own mempools and propagate it to their neighbors—transaction is gossiped throughout the network.
4. Block builder selects a transaction from its local mempool, which is guaranteed to be propagated through the network due to steps 1-3.
5. Block builder constructs a block proposal with references to selected transactions.
6. Block proposal is sent through the Blend Network, which requires multiple rounds of gossiping. This introduces a delay that ensures the transaction has reached most of the network participants' mempools.
7. Block proposal is received by validators.
8. Validators match each reference prefix in `references` against the transactions in their local mempool.
9. If every reference resolves to a mempool transaction and the resolved set reproduces `header.block_root`, the block proposal is reconstructed and proceeds to further validation steps; otherwise the validator rejects it, without that being a finding of invalidity — see [Reference Resolution](#reference-resolution).

### Reference Resolution

A reference is a 16-byte (`REFERENCE_PREFIX_LENGTH`) prefix of the transaction hash. Because two distinct transaction hashes cannot be made or found to share a 16-byte prefix at any feasible cost (see [Prefix length and collision resistance](#prefix-length-and-collision-resistance)), a validator resolves each reference to exactly one local mempool transaction:

```python
def resolve(reference, mempool):
    matches = [tx for tx in mempool
               if prefix(mantle_txhash(tx), REFERENCE_PREFIX_LENGTH) == reference]
    return matches[0] if len(matches) == 1 else None
```

A reference resolves only when the match is unique. Zero matches means the transaction is absent locally; two or more would mean a prefix collision, which is infeasible to manufacture and vanishingly unlikely to occur by chance, and is treated as unresolved rather than searched, so that resolution never branches. Because the match is unique when it exists, the result does not depend on the order in which the mempool is scanned.

Reconstruction considers every entry of `references`; the list has no padding. A proposal whose reference count exceeds `MAX_BLOCK_TXS` is rejected at decode time, as specified in [References](#references). The proposal is reconstructed when every reference resolves to a transaction and the Merkle root over the resolved transactions' full hashes reproduces `header.block_root`; otherwise it is rejected. Resolution is a function of the proposal and the validator's mempool alone, so two validators holding the same mempool always reach the same decision.

A reference resolving to no local transaction means the referenced transaction has not reached this validator's mempool, which the transaction maturity assumption above is designed to prevent. The validator rejects the proposal and does not build on it. It **must not** record that outcome as a verdict on `block_id`: the block may be received again, in full, through chain synchronisation, and is then validated on its merits. This is unlike the mempool-independent failures in [Block Proposal Validation](#block-proposal-validation) — a frame that does not decode, a bad signature, an invalid proof of leadership — which are properties of the proposal itself, identical at every node, and final.

The `header.block_root` check is what makes resolution safe against the residual, cryptographically-negligible case of a prefix matching the wrong transaction: a mismatched set never reproduces the root.

### Binding of the reference list

Neither the reference entries nor their count are covered by `signature` or by `block_id`, both of which range over `header` only. `header.block_root` is therefore the **sole** mechanism binding a proposal to its reference list and to the number of references: any altered reference set, and any altered count, fails to reproduce `header.block_root` and the proposal is rejected. The argument is given in [Why `block_root` alone binds the reference list](#why-block_root-alone-binds-the-reference-list).

Two operational consequences follow:

- Tampered copies of a genuine proposal are cheap to produce, since `references` is unauthenticated. They are also cheap to discard: `block_id` is computable from the 297-byte header alone, so duplicate suppression on `block_id` collapses every tampered variant of one genuine proposal into a single unit of reconstruction work.
- Reconstruction must not be the first expensive step. It is a mempool scan, so it should follow signature and PoL verification, and an unauthenticated proposal must be discarded before any mempool scanning takes place.

## Block Proposal Validation

This section defines the procedure followed by a Logos Blockchain node to validate a received block proposal.

Given a `proposal`, a proposed block consisting of a `header`, `references` and a `signature`. This block proposal is considered valid if the following conditions are met, checked **in the order given** so that the cheapest checks discard a malformed or unauthenticated proposal first.

The order is constrained as well as economical. [Block Header Validation](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#block-header-validation) is defined over a block $`B = (header, transactions)`$, but a proposal carries `references` rather than transactions, so the rules that range over `transactions` cannot be evaluated until reconstruction has produced them. They are therefore applied in the step where their operand exists, and each is named below.

1. **Decoding**
  The received bytes must decode to a `proposal` under [Canonical Encoding](#canonical-encoding): the frame must be consumed exactly, with no trailing bytes, and the `references` element count must not exceed `MAX_BLOCK_TXS`. This check precedes any allocation proportional to the count and any mempool lookup. Because a proposal references each transaction exactly once, this also discharges rule 3 of [Block Header Validation](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#block-header-validation), `length(transactions) <= MAX_BLOCK_TXS`.

2. **Header Validation**
  The `header` must satisfy the rules of [Block Header Validation](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#block-header-validation) that range over the header and the block tree alone: the bedrock version, the slot ordering against the parent, the wallclock check, the presence of the parent in the block tree, the height against the latest immutable block, and the leader's right to propose — that is, rules 1 and 5 through 9. These need no mempool access, and rule 9 covers `signature` and the proof of leadership, so an unauthenticated proposal is discarded here, before any mempool scanning.

3. **Block Proposal Reconstruction**
  Every `references` prefix must resolve to a local mempool transaction, and the resolved set must reproduce `header.block_root`, as defined in [Reference Resolution](#reference-resolution). This step produces `transactions` and, in reproducing `block_root`, discharges rule 4 of [Block Header Validation](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#block-header-validation).

4. **Block Body Validation**
  With `transactions` now available, the remaining rule of [Block Header Validation](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#block-header-validation) applies: rule 2, `bytes(transactions) <= MAX_BLOCK_SIZE`.

5. **Mempool Transactions Validation**
  `mempool_transactions` must refer to a valid sequence of Mantle Transactions from the mempool. Each transaction must be valid according to the rules defined in the [Mantle](bedrock-v1.1-mantle-specification.md). In order to verify ZK proofs, they are batched for verification as explained in [Batch verification of ZK proofs](#batch-verification-of-zk-proofs) to get better performance.

If any of the above checks fail, the block proposal must be rejected, subject to the distinction in [Reference Resolution](#reference-resolution) between a failure to reconstruct and a finding of invalidity.

This ordering is specific to the proposal path. A block received in full through chain synchronisation carries its transactions from the start, so [Block Header Validation](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#block-header-validation) applies to it as written, with no ordering constraint.

## Block Execution

This section specifies how a Logos Blockchain node executes a valid block proposal to update its local state.

Given a `ValidBlock` that has successfully passed proposal validation, the node must:

1. Append the `leader_voucher` contained in the block to the set of reward vouchers **when the following epoch starts**.
2. Execute the reward distribution protocol defined in [**Service Reward Distribution Protocol**](bedrock-service-reward-distribution.md) to generate reward notes locally and include them in the ledger.
3. Execute the Mantle Transactions included in the block sequentially, using the execution rules defined in the [Mantle](bedrock-v1.1-mantle-specification.md).

`REFERENCE_PREFIX_LENGTH = 16` is chosen so that a collision between two 16-byte prefixes cannot be manufactured. Two distinct attacks have to be priced separately, because they cost very differently.

Write $`b = 8 \cdot`$ `REFERENCE_PREFIX_LENGTH` for the prefix length in bits, so $`b = 128`$ at the chosen parameter.

**Targeted collision.** To make a reference resolve to the wrong transaction — for example to censor one specific transaction `T` — an attacker must produce a transaction whose prefix equals `T`'s. That is a fixed target, matched with probability $`2^{-b}`$ per attempt, so it costs ≈ $`2^{b} = 2^{128}`$ work: infeasible by an enormous margin.

**Self-collision.** To merely create *ambiguity* — two transactions sharing a prefix, so a reference matches more than one — the attacker does not need a specific target. They generate their own candidate transactions and wait for any two to collide. This is a birthday search, which finds a colliding pair after only ≈ $`2^{b/2}`$ candidates rather than $`2^{b}`$: the number of candidate *pairs* grows as the square of the number of candidates, so a collision appears once $`N^2/2 \approx 2^{b}`$, i.e. $`N \approx 2^{b/2}`$. Grinding a candidate is cheap — `mantle_txhash` covers the `MantleTx` alone and not the `op_proofs` of the enclosing `SignedMantleTx`, so each candidate costs one encoding and one hash, and nothing is signed until a pair is found.

The self-collision cost is the one that governs the parameter, because it is the cheaper of the two and it is what an attacker needs to force reconstruction failures. At the 8-byte prefix of an earlier revision ($`b = 64`$) it was only ≈ $`2^{32}`$ — under a second of GPU hashing — which is why that revision needed a construction-side ambiguity bound and a validator-side reconstruction cap to survive grindable collisions. At 16 bytes the birthday cost is ≈ $`2^{64}`$: about 58 years on one GPU at $`10^{10}`$ hashes per second, and still ~214 days against a 100× adversary. Manufacturing even a single ambiguous pair is therefore infeasible, and the whole class of grinding attacks disappears along with the machinery that managed it. Every reference resolves to exactly one transaction, reconstruction is a deterministic lookup, and `header.block_root` remains the backstop for the residual, cryptographically-negligible random collision.

The cost is that references are twice as long as at 8 bytes, so the proposal grows from at most 8,555 bytes to at most 16,747 bytes. That is still a ≈2× reduction against the 33,129-byte fixed layout of master, and it buys reconstruction that no adversary can perturb — for a consensus structure, the stronger property is worth the bytes.

## Why `block_root` alone binds the reference list

This annex substantiates [Binding of the reference list](#binding-of-the-reference-list).

It is not the case that tampering with `references` is caught by the signature. An attacker who truncates or extends the list and adjusts the 2-byte count to match produces a frame that is still well-formed and whose header bytes are untouched, so `signature` still verifies. Framing gives unambiguity, not tamper-detection.

What rules the tampering out is `block_root`, in two steps:

1. `block_root` is a Merkle root over the **full** 32-byte transaction hashes, with the leaf set padded to the next power of two using all-zero leaves ([Block Header Validation](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#block-header-validation)). Changing the number of leaves across a power-of-two boundary changes the depth of the tree and therefore the root.
2. Within a boundary, an added leaf would have to hash to the all-zero value to leave the root unchanged. Reconstruction rejects any reference that resolves to no mempool transaction, so every leaf must be the hash of a real Mantle Transaction, and producing one whose hash is all-zero is infeasible.

Relative to a design that carries the count in the signed header, this removes one of two independent mechanisms rather than adding one: the count would be bound both by the signature and by `block_root`, and is now bound by `block_root` alone. That is an acceptable trade because the count is not a security binding. Its only role is to remove the parsing ambiguity between a genuine all-zero reference and zero padding, and an explicit length prefix removes that ambiguity directly, at the same cost in bytes and without a fixed-size layout.

## Batch verification of ZK proofs

### Proofs of Claim

1. For each proof of Claim, the verifier collects the classic Groth16 elements required for verification. It includes the proof $`\pi^{(i)}`$, and the public values $`x_j^{(i)}`$ for each proof of claim.
2. The verifier draws one random value for each proof $`r_i \overset{\$}{\leftarrow} \mathbb{F}_p`$.
3. The verifier computes:
1. $`\pi'_{j} := \sum_{i=1}^k r_i \cdot \pi_j^{(i)}`$ for $`j \in \{A,B,C\}`$.
2. $`r' := \sum_{i=1}^k r_i`$
3. $`IC := r' \cdot \Psi_0 + \sum_{j=1}^l\left( \sum_{i=1}^k r_i \cdot x_j^{(i)} \right) \cdot \Psi_j`$

4. They test if $`\sum_{i=1}^k e(r_1\pi'_A,\pi'_B) = e(r'[\alpha]_1,[\beta]_2)+ e(IC,[\gamma]_2) + e(\pi'_C,[\delta]_2)`$.

  Note that this batch verification of Groth16 proofs is the same as what is described in the Zcash paper, Appendix B.2.

### ZkSignatures

The verifier follows the same procedure as in [Proofs of Claim](#proofs-of-claim) but with the Groth16 proofs of ZkSignatures.

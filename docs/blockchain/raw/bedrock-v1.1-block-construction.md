# Introduction

In this document, we present the specification defining the construction of the block proposal, its validation, and execution. We define the block proposal construction that contains references to transactions (from the mempool) instead of a complete transaction to limit its length. The raw block body increases with the size of transactions it contains up to `MAX_BLOCK_SIZE`, which is 2 MiB and covers the transactions only, and the proposal compresses its size down to 33 kB, which saves the bandwidth necessary to broadcast new blocks.

# Overview

For the consensus protocol to make progress, a new **leader** is elected through the leader lottery. The new leader is in possession of a proof of leadership (PoL) that confirms that it is indeed the leader. The main objective of the leader is to construct a new block, hence becoming a **block builder,** and share it with other members of the network as a **block proposer**. The block must be correctly constructed; otherwise, it will be rejected by the consensus nodes who are validating every block. Only validated blocks are executed, which means that the transactions included in the block are interpreted by all nodes, and the state of the chain is modified according to the instructions embedded in the transactions.

## High-level Flow

Below, we present a high-level description of the block lifecycle. The main focus of this section is to build an intuition on the block construction, validation, and execution.

1. A leader is selected. The leader becomes a block builder.
2. The block builder **constructs** a block proposal.
1. The block builder selects the latest block (parent) as the reference point for the chain state update.
2. The block builder selects valid Mantle Transactions (as defined in [Mantle](bedrock-v1.1-mantle-specification.md)) from its mempool and includes references to them in the proposal.
3. The block builder populates the block header of the block proposal.

3. The block proposer sends the block proposal to the Blend network.
4. The validators receive the block proposal.
5. The validators **validate** the block proposal.
1. They validate the block header.
2. They retrieve complete transactions from their mempool that are referred in the block.
3. They validate each transaction included in the block.

6. The validators **execute** the block proposal.
1. They derive the new blockchain state from the previous one by executing transactions as defined in [Mantle](bedrock-v1.1-mantle-specification.md).
2. They update the different variables that need to be maintained over time.
3. They execute the [**Service Reward Distribution Protocol**](bedrock-service-reward-distribution.md) to generate reward notes locally.

# Constructions

## Hash

We are using two hashing algorithms that have the same output length of 256 bits (32 bytes) that are [Poseidon2 and Blake2b](common-cryptographic-components.md).

## Block Proposal

A block proposal, instead of containing complete Mantle Transactions of an unlimited size, contains references of fixed size to the transactions. The proposal also carries the full signed headers of the uncles it references, so that every node holding the block holds those headers as well. The size of the proposal varies with the number of referenced uncles: from 33130 bytes (no uncles) up to the maximum of 34574 bytes (`MAX_UNCLES` referenced uncles). The indistinguishability of proposals required by the [Blend Protocol](blend-protocol.md) is provided at the message layer: every dispersed proposal is padded up to the maximum payload size `Max_Body_Length = 34574` bytes — set from the maximum proposal size — by [Payload Formatting](payload-formatting.md).

We define the following message structure:

```python
class Proposal:                                     # 33130..34574 bytes
    header: Header                                  # 297 bytes
    uncle_headers: list[SignedHeader]               # 1 + n × 361 bytes
    references: References                          # 32768 bytes
    signature: Ed25519Signature                     # 64 bytes

class SignedHeader:                                 # 361 bytes
    header: Header                                  # 297 bytes
    signature: Ed25519Signature                     # 64 bytes
```

Where:

- `header` is the header of the proposal; defined below: [Header](#header).
- `uncle_headers` is a variable-size list carrying the full signed headers of the referenced uncles, with at most `MAX_UNCLES` entries. Each entry holds an uncle block header together with the signature of that header under its `leader_key` — the header and signature as originally received with the uncle's own proposal. This list *is* the reference: the block ID ([Cryptarchia Protocol](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#block-id)) of an uncle is derived from its carried header and is not recorded separately. Like every list, it is serialized as a 1-byte little-endian element count followed by that many entries, and a decoder must reject a count exceeding `MAX_UNCLES`. The `uncles` field having been removed from the [Header](#header), each entry is a fixed 361 bytes — a 297-byte header plus a 64-byte signature — so the list of carried headers parses unambiguously from its element count alone. The whole list, signatures included, is committed by `header.body_root` and therefore by the block ID, so no two blocks sharing an ID can differ in a carried signature. The proposal length reveals how many uncles are referenced — proposal indistinguishability is provided by the message-layer padding of [Payload Formatting](payload-formatting.md), not by the encoding. The proposer chooses which uncles to reference according to [Uncle Selection](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#uncle-selection), and every entry must satisfy the validity rules of [Uncle References](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#uncle-references) or the block is rejected. The same list is carried over into the reconstructed [Block](#block), which is what makes every referenced uncle structurally available: those rules can be evaluated by any node holding the chain, including nodes bootstrapping from genesis that never receive the proposal.
- `references` is a set of 1024 references to transactions of a `hash` type; the size of the `hash` type is 32 bytes and is the transaction hash as defined in [Mantle Transaction](bedrock-v1.1-mantle-specification.md#mantle-transaction).
- `signature` is the signature of the complete `header` using the `leader_key` from the `ProofOfLeadership`; the size of the `Ed25519Signature` type is 64 bytes.

  The length of the `references` list must be preserved to maintain the message’s indistinguishability in the Blend protocol. Therefore, the list must be padded with zeros when necessary.

### Header

```python
class Header:                                # 297 bytes
    bedrock_version: byte                    # 1 byte
    parent_block: hash                       # 32 bytes
    slot: SlotNumber                         # 8 bytes
    body_root: hash                          # 32 bytes
    proof_of_leadership: ProofOfLeadership   # 224 bytes
```

Where:

- `bedrock_version` is the version of the proposal message structure that supports other protocols defined in linked reference; its size is 1 byte and is fixed to `0x01`.
- `parent_block` is the block ID ([Cryptarchia Protocol](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md)) of the parent block, validated and accepted by the block builder. It is used for the derivation of the `AgedLedger` and `LatestLedger` values necessary for validating the PoL; the size of the `hash` is 32 bytes.
- `slot` is the consensus slot number; the size of the `SlotNumber` type is 8 bytes.
- `body_root` is the commitment to the block body — both the carried `uncle_headers` and the transactions. It is computed as defined in step 4 of [Block Header Validation](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#block-header-validation), which combines the serialized `uncle_headers` list with the root of the Merkle tree constructed from transaction hashes (defined in [Mantle Transaction](bedrock-v1.1-mantle-specification.md#mantle-transaction)) — the same hashes used for constructing the `references` list in the `mempool_transactions`; the size of the `hash` is 32 bytes. Since the block ID is taken over the header, committing the uncle headers here is what makes two blocks with the same ID identical byte for byte.
- `proof_of_leadership` is the proof confirming that the sender is the leader; defined below: [Proof of Leadership](#proof-of-leadership).

### References

```python
class References:                            # 32768 bytes
    mempool_transactions: list[hash]         # 1024 * 32 bytes
```

Where `mempool_transactions` is a set of up to 1024 references to transactions of a `hash` type; the size of the `hash` type is 32 bytes and is the transaction hash as defined in [Mantle Transaction](bedrock-v1.1-mantle-specification.md#mantle-transaction).

### Proof of Leadership

```python
class ProofOfLeadership:                     # 224 bytes
    leader_voucher: RewardVoucher            # 32 bytes
    entropy_contribution: zkhash             # 32 bytes
    proof: ProofOfLeadership                 # 128 bytes
    leader_key: Ed25519PublicKey             # 32 bytes
```

Where:

- `leader_voucher` is the voucher value used for retrieving the reward by the leader for proposal; the size of the `RewardVoucher` is 32 bytes.
- `entropy_contribution` is the output of the PoL contribution for Cryptarchia entropy; the size of the `zkhash` type is 32 bytes.
- `proof` is the proof confirming that the proposal is constructed by the leader; the size of the `ProofOfLeadership` type is 128 bytes (2 compressed $`\mathbb{G}_1`$and 1 compressed $`\mathbb{G}_2`$ BN256 elements).
- `leader_key` is the one-time `Ed25519PublicKey` used for signing the `Proposal`. This binds the content of the proposal with the `ProofOfLeadership`; the size of the `Ed25519PublicKey` type is 32 bytes.

## Block

A **block** is what a proposal becomes once its references have been resolved against the mempool, and it is the unit that nodes store, execute and serve to their peers — in particular over [Downloading Blocks](cryptarchia-v1-bootstr-sync.md#downloading-blocks) during synchronization, where proposals are never transferred.

```python
class Block:
    header: Header                           # 297 bytes
    signature: Ed25519Signature              # 64 bytes
    uncle_headers: list[SignedHeader]        # 1 + n × 361 bytes, n <= MAX_UNCLES
    transactions: list[SignedMantleTx]       # up to MAX_BLOCK_SIZE
```

Where:

- `header` is the header of the proposal the block was reconstructed from, unchanged; defined above: [Header](#header).
- `signature` is the proposal signature over that `header`, carried over unchanged. It is retained because `block_id` commits to the header alone and therefore does not cover the signature, so a node that receives the block without ever seeing the proposal — as happens during synchronization — would otherwise have nothing to check against step 9 of [Block Header Validation](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#block-header-validation); the size of the `Ed25519Signature` type is 64 bytes.
- `uncle_headers` is the list carried over verbatim from the proposal, defined above: [Block Proposal](#block-proposal). It is committed by `header.body_root`, so it cannot be altered, reordered or truncated without changing the block ID, and every entry must satisfy the validity rules of [Uncle References](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#uncle-references) for the block to be valid.
- `transactions` is the sequence of Mantle Transactions resolved from `references` during [Block Proposal Reconstruction](#block-proposal-reconstruction).

The `uncle_headers` list is part of the block rather than only of the proposal because both [Block Header Validation](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#block-header-validation) and the [Total Stake Inference](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#total-stake-inference) need it. A node that obtained the chain by synchronizing from its peers — which transfers blocks, not proposals — would otherwise hold no record of the referenced uncles at all: it could not apply the validity rules of [Uncle References](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#uncle-references) to the blocks it downloads, could not compute $`N_\text{BLOCKS}`$, and therefore could not derive the difficulty $`D`$ that gates Proof-of-Leadership validity in the following epoch. Carrying the list in the block makes both the validation and the inference reproducible from chain data alone, for a bootstrapping node exactly as for a node that followed the chain live.

As with the header, `uncle_headers` does not count towards `MAX_BLOCK_SIZE`, which bounds the block body — the serialized `transactions` — only. The uncle payload is bounded independently by `MAX_UNCLES` entries per block.

## Proposal Construction

In this section, we explain how the block proposal structure presented above is populated by the consensus leader.

The block proposal is constructed by the leader of the current slot. The node becomes a leader only after successfully generating a valid PoL for a given `(Epoch, Slot)`.

### Prerequisites

Before constructing the proposal, the block builder must:

1. Select a valid parent block referenced by `ParentBlock` on which they will extend the chain.
2. Derive the required Ledger state snapshots `AgedLedger` and `LatestLedger` from the state of the chain including the last block.
3. Select a valid unspent note winning the PoL.
4. Generate a valid PoL proving leadership eligibility for `(Epoch, Slot)` based on the selected note. Attach the PoL to a one-time Ed25519 public key used to sign the block proposal.

Only after the PoL is generated can the block proposal be constructed (see [Proof of Leadership](cryptarchia-proof-of-leadership.md)).

### Construction Procedure

1. Initialize proposal metadata with the last known state of the blockchain. Set the:
  - `header`:
    - `bedrock_version`
    - `parent_block`
    - `slot`
    - `body_root` — left unset here; it is computed in step 4, once both parts of the body are known
    - `proof_of_leadership`:
      - `leader_voucher`
      - `entropy_contribution`
      - `proof`
      - `leader_key`
  - `uncle_headers`: the full signed headers — header and signature as received with the uncle's own proposal — of the uncles chosen by [Uncle Selection](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#uncle-selection), in selection order. Every entry must satisfy the validity rules of [Uncle References](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#uncle-references) against the chain the proposal extends, or the resulting block will be rejected; because those rules read only that chain and the entry itself, the proposer can verify this before publishing.

2. Construct the `mempool_transactions` object:
1. Select Mantle transactions:
    - Choose up to `1024` valid `SignedMantleTx` from the local mempool.
    - Ensure each transaction:
      - Is valid according to [Mantle](bedrock-v1.1-mantle-specification.md).
      - Has no conflicts with others (e.g., two transactions trying to spend the same note).

3. Derive references values:
```python
references: list[hash] = [mantle_txhash(tx) for tx in mempool_transactions]
```

4. Compute the `header.body_root` over both parts of the body, as defined in step 4 of [Block Header Validation](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#block-header-validation): the serialized `uncle_headers` list from step 1, combined with the root of the Merkle tree constructed from the `mempool_transactions` transactions used to build `references`. This step therefore comes after both uncle selection and transaction selection.
5. Sign the block proposal header.
```text
signature = Ed25519.sign(leader_secret_key, header)
```

6. Assemble the block proposal.
```python
proposal = Proposal(
    header,
    uncle_headers,
    references,
    signature
)
```

  The PoL must have been generated beforehand and bound to the same Ledger view as mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

The constructed proposal can now be broadcast to the network for validation.

## Block Proposal Reconstruction

Given a block proposal, we assume *transaction maturity*. This means that the block proposal must include transactions from the mempool that have had enough time to spread across the network to reach all nodes. This ensures that transactions are widely known and recognized before block reconstruction.

This transaction maturity assumption holds true because the block proposal must be sent through the Blend Network before it reaches validators and can be reconstructed. The Blend Network introduces significant delay, ensuring that transactions referenced in the proposal have reached all network participants. This approach is crucial for maintaining smooth network operation and reducing the risk that proposals get rejected due to transactions being unavailable to some validators. Moreover, by increasing the number of nodes that have seen the transaction, anonymity is also enhanced as the set of nodes with the same view is larger. This may result in increased difficulty—or even practical prevention—of executing deanonymization attacks such as tagging attacks.

Upon receipt of a block proposal, validators must confirm the presence of all referenced transactions within their local mempool. This verification is an absolute requirement—if even a single referenced transaction is missing from the validator's mempool, the entire proposal must be rejected. This stringent validation protocol ensures only widely-distributed transactions are included in the blockchain, safeguarding against potential network state fragmentation.

The process works as follows:

1. Transaction is added to the node mempool.
2. Node sends the transaction to all its neighbors.
3. Neighbors add the transaction to their own mempools and propagate it to their neighbors—transaction is gossiped throughout the network.
4. Block builder selects a transaction from its local mempool, which is guaranteed to be propagated through the network due to steps 1-3.
5. Block builder constructs a block proposal with references to selected transactions.
6. Block proposal is sent through the Blend Network, which requires multiple rounds of gossiping. This introduces a delay that ensures the transaction has reached most of the network participants' mempools.
7. Block proposal is received by validators.
8. Validators check their local mempools for all referenced transactions from the proposal.
9. If any transaction is missing, the entire proposal is rejected.
10. If all transactions are present, the block proposal is reconstructed and proceeds to further validation steps.

Reconstruction assembles the [Block](#block) from the proposal's `header` and `signature`, its `uncle_headers` copied over verbatim, and the transactions resolved from `references` in the order the references appear. The `uncle_headers` list is retained rather than discarded: it is not recoverable from the mempool, it is committed by `header.body_root` and so cannot be dropped without invalidating the block, and once the proposal has been consumed the block is the only carrier of the signed uncle headers that [Block Header Validation](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#block-header-validation) and the [Total Stake Inference](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#total-stake-inference) need.

## Block Proposal Validation

This section defines the procedure followed by a Logos Blockchain node to validate a received block proposal.

Given a `proposal`, a proposed block consisting of a `header`, `uncle_headers` and `references`. This block proposal is considered valid if the following conditions are met:

1. **Block Validation**
  The `proposal` must satisfy the rules defined in [Block Header Validation](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#block-header-validation). This includes step 10, which requires every entry of `uncle_headers` to be a valid uncle of the block (see [Uncle References](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#uncle-references)).

2. **Body Root Consistency**
  `header.body_root` must equal the body root computed over the carried `uncle_headers` and the transactions the `references` resolve to. This restates step 4 of [Block Header Validation](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#block-header-validation) at the message level, because the consequence of failing it here is different: a mismatch means the message was corrupted in transit or malformed by its proposer, not that the block it names is invalid. The block ID is taken over the header, so a corrupted copy and the genuine block share no identity, and well-formed bytes exist and are held by the proposer and by every node that accepted the block. Such a proposal must be discarded and may be re-requested from any other holder, and no verdict about the underlying block may be recorded from it. Once `body_root` matches, the `uncle_headers` are exactly the bytes the proposer committed to, and step 10 decides the block on their merits.

3. **Block Proposal Reconstruction**
  The `references` must refer to existing `mempool_transaction` entries that are retrievable from the node's local mempool.

4. **Mempool Transactions Validation**
  `mempool_transactions` must refer to a valid sequence of Mantle Transactions from the mempool. Each transaction must be valid according to the rules defined in the [Mantle](bedrock-v1.1-mantle-specification.md). In order to verify ZK proofs, they are batched for verification as explained in [Batch verification of ZK proofs](#batch-verification-of-zk-proofs) to get better performance.

If any of the above checks fail, the block proposal must be rejected.

## Block Execution

This section specifies how a Logos Blockchain node executes a valid block proposal to update its local state.

Given a `ValidBlock` that has successfully passed proposal validation, the node must:

1. Append the `leader_voucher` contained in the block to the set of reward vouchers **when the following epoch starts**.
2. Execute the reward distribution protocol defined in [**Service Reward Distribution Protocol**](bedrock-service-reward-distribution.md) to generate reward notes locally and include them in the ledger.
3. Execute the Mantle Transactions included in the block sequentially, using the execution rules defined in the [Mantle](bedrock-v1.1-mantle-specification.md).

The carried `uncle_headers` are not executed. A referenced uncle is not part of the chain; therefore, its transactions have no effect on the ledger state. The uncles are used only as evidence of consensus participation for the [Total Stake Inference](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#total-stake-inference).

# Annex

## Batch verification of ZK proofs

### Proofs of Claim

1. For each proof of Claim, the verifier collects the classic Groth16 elements required for verification. It includes the proof $`\pi^{(i)}`$, and the public values $`x_j^{(i)}`$ for each proof of claim.
2. The verifier draws one random value for each proof $`r_i \overset{\$}{\leftarrow} \mathbb{F}_p`$.
3. The verifier computes:
1. $`\pi'_{j} := \sum_{i=1}^k r_i \cdot \pi_j^{(i)}`$ for $`j \in \{A,B,C\}`$.
2. $`r' := \sum_{i=1}^k r_i`$
3. $`IC := r' \cdot \Psi_0 + \sum_{j=1}^l\left( \sum_{i=1}^k r_i \cdot x_j^{(i)} \right) \cdot \Psi_j`$

4. They test if $`\sum_{i=1}^k e(r_1\pi'_A,\pi'_B) = e(r'[\alpha]_1,[\beta]_2)+ e(IC,[\gamma]_2) + e(\pi'_C,[\delta]_2)`$.

  Note that this batch verification of Groth16 proofs is the same as what is described in the Zcash paper, Appendix B.2.

### ZkSignatures

The verifier follows the same procedure as in [Proofs of Claim](#proofs-of-claim) but with the Groth16 proofs of ZkSignatures.

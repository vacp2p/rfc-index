# Introduction

In Mantle, each Mantle Transaction contains one or more Operations. These components consume gas, measured through fixed gas units that reflect their execution or storage impact. Logos Blockchain introduces two independent gas markets:

- Execution Gas: measuring computational workload.
- Permanent Storage Gas: measuring cost of fully replicated storage.

Gas constants are carefully calibrated to reflect the computational and storage requirements of different operations on Logos Blockchain. By standardizing gas measurements, the system can accurately charge fees proportional to resource usage, preventing network abuse and incentivizing efficient transaction design.

# Overview

We conducted a comprehensive analysis of execution requirements for each Operation type in Mantle Transactions. This detailed examination allowed us to determine precise gas amounts for each Operation based on the actual computational resources consumed.

The gas constants we established are strategically divided between permanent storage and execution components, directly proportional to their respective resource utilization within Mantle Transactions. This separation ensures that gas costs accurately reflect the true computational burden of different operations. Moreover, gas can also be adjusted arbitrarily to incentivize or disincentivize the usage of certain Operations compared to others.

Our methodology involved measuring execution complexity and defining how gas is determined for each Gas Market. This is critical for proper network operation as it directly impacts transaction prioritization and network economics.

## Permanent Storage Gas

Permanent Storage is paid directly for the entire signed Mantle Transaction. The Permanent Storage Gas price is derived from [Storage Markets](storage-markets.md) and is used to determine the Permanent Storage fee. 1 Permanent Storage Gas corresponds to 1 byte.

```python
permanent_storage_fee = len(encode(tx_signed)) * permanent_storage_gas_price
```

## Execution Gas

Execution is a second general market that represents how costly an Operation is to execute. This cost can be fixed or variable based on the content of the Operation. The Execution Gas base price is derived from [Execution Market](execution-market.md) and each Operation defines its execution gas amount. 1 Execution Gas corresponds to 1,000 CPU cycles.

```python
execution_base_fee = tx.ops.get_summed_gas() * execution_gas_base_price
```

The gas derivation of each Operation are:

```python
TRANSFER_GAS                  = 590
CHANNEL_INSCRIBE_GAS          = 56
CHANNEL_CONFIG_GAS            = 56 * configuration_threshold
CHANNEL_DEPOSIT_GAS           = 590
CHANNEL_TRANSFER_GAS          = 56 * stake_manipulation_threshold
CHANNEL_WITHDRAW_GAS          = 56 * stake_manipulation_threshold
SDP_DECLARE_GAS               = 646
SDP_WITHDRAW_GAS              = 590
SDP_ACTIVE_GAS                = 590
LEADER_CLAIM_GAS              = 580
CLAIM_POW_REWARD_GAS          = 56
```

and come from our implementation observations as described in [Gas determination from measures](#gas-determination-from-measures).  To get these numbers, we based our calculations on the following measures:

| Operation | Number of CPU cycles |
| --- | --- |
| ZkSignature batch verification | 3,900,000 + number_of_proof x 590,000 |
| Proof of Claim batch verification | 2,640,000 + number_of_proof x 580,000 |
| Eddsa25519 signature verification | 56,000 |

Comparison, list searching, hashes and operation in small fields are neglected. We also supposed that the initialization cost for batch verification is paid by everyone and deduced from the block directly. The user then pay only for the part that is proportional to the number of proofs.

# Transfer

- Derivation of the note identifiers: negligible
## Channel Inscription

The validation process includes verifying an Eddsa25519 signature, confirming that the signer is authorized for the specified channel, and checking the chaining sequence of the channel. The execution encompasses creating channel records (if not previously used) and updating the tip of the channel.

Execution: ~56k CPU cycles.

- Verification of the Ed25519 signature: 56,000 cycles.
- Verification of the signer authorization: negligible.
- Verification of channel sequencing: negligible

    - Verification of the configuration_threshold Ed25519 signatures: 56,000 cycles per signature.
    - Modification of the state of the channel: negligible.

## SDP Declaration

This gas covers multiple verification processes: confirming ownership of the service note through ZkSignature verification, validating the zk_id via a second ZkSignature, and establishing ownership of the provider_id through an Eddsa25519 signature. It also includes verification of the declaration format, confirmation of note existence, validation that the note is not already used for this service, and verification of its amount. Additionally, it accounts for the computational costs associated with the note service locking mechanism and declaration management.

Execution: ~ 646k CPU cycles.

- Verification of the Ed25519 signature: 56,000 cycles.
- Verification of the ZK signature: 590,000 cycles.

- Verification of service note existence: negligible.
- Verification of service note value: negligible.
- Verification that the note isn’t already used for the service: negligible.
- Register the note as a service note: negligible.
## SDP Withdraw

This gas covers a verification process that includes: confirming ownership of the zk_id through ZkSignature verification, validating the existence of the service note, verifying that the note has exceeded its lock period, and confirming that the declaration exists and has not been previously withdrawn. The validation process also ensures that the withdrawal message's nonce is greater than any previous nonce, preventing replay attacks. During execution, the system updates the declaration's status to withdrawn, removes the declaration from the service note's associated declarations, and—if the note has no remaining declarations—removes it from the service notes dictionary.

Execution: ~ 590k CPU cycles.

- Verification that the service note exists and is bound to the declaration: negligible.
- Verification that the note can be unlocked: negligible.
- Verification that the declaration exist: negligible.

- Verification of nonce incrementation: negligible.
- Update declaration: negligible.
- Remove declaration from service note: negligible.
- Unlock the note if not linked to any declaration: negligible.
## SDP Activation

This gas funds the verification of the zk_id signature through the ZkSignature verification process, validates the existence of the declaration in the system, and ensures that the activation message's nonce is greater than any previous nonce to prevent replay attacks. The validation includes confirming that the declaration ID is present in the declarations dictionary and that the signature corresponds to the declaration's registered zk_id public key.

- Execution: ~590k CPU cycles.
    - Verification that the declaration exist: negligible.
    - Verification of nonce incrementation: negligible.
    - Verification of the ZK signature: 590,000 cycles.
    - Evaluation of the activity depends on the service and is neglected here

## Leader Claims

This gas covers the verification of reward voucher ownership through a Proof of Claim, confirmation that the voucher nullifier is not already present in the nullifier set, and validation that the rewards root exists in the list of recent voucher Merkle tree roots. The execution process involves adding the voucher nullifier to the nullifier set and increasing the Mantle Transaction balance by the designated leader reward amount.

Execution: ~580k CPU cycles.

- Verification that the voucher nullifier isn’t already in the set: negligible.
- Verification that the rewards root is one of the root of the reward tree of the last blocks: negligible.
- Verification of the proof of claim: 580,000 cycles.
- Insertion of the nullifier in the voucher nullifier set: negligible.
- Insertion of the note in the ledger: negligible.
- Derivation of the note identifiers: negligible

## Claim PoW Reward

This gas covers the re-derivation of the puzzle ticket from the Operation payload, the comparison of that ticket against the reward difficulty, the lookup confirming the referenced block is canonical and within the acceptance window, the check that the ticket is not already in the nullifier set, and the check that the pool can cover a reward. Execution then inserts the nullifier, creates a single output note and decrements the pool.

Execution: dominated by one hash over three field elements. Every other step is a comparison or a set or map lookup.

- Re-derivation of the puzzle ticket: one `zkhash` over three field elements.
- Comparison of the ticket against the reward difficulty: negligible.
- Lookup of the referenced block and the slot window comparison: negligible.
- Verification that the ticket isn't already in the nullifier set: negligible.
- Verification that the pool covers the per-claim reward: negligible.
- Insertion of the nullifier in the set: negligible.
- Insertion of the note in the ledger: negligible.
- Derivation of the note identifiers: negligible.

Unlike every other Operation in this document, this one verifies no proof and no signature, so it has no batch-verification component and no term proportional to a number of proofs.

It is therefore not comparable to `LEADER_CLAIM`, whose 580 is entirely the 580,000 cycle Proof of Claim verification that this Operation does not perform. The comparable Operations are the channel ones at 56, whose cost is one Eddsa25519 signature verification — and this Operation does not verify a signature either.

`CLAIM_POW_REWARD_GAS` is set to **56**, adopting that tier as a conservative over-estimate rather than pricing the Operation at zero. It should be confirmed by measurement on the same basis as the others.

A claim is intended to pay its own fee out of the reward it creates, so this gas contributes to the floor the per-claim reward must clear, and it constrains the reward parameters rather than merely pricing the Operation. Pricing it at `LEADER_CLAIM_GAS` would nearly double the claim transaction's execution gas, since the transaction already carries a `TRANSFER` at 590.

# Introduction

This document defines an implementation-friendly specification of the Proof of Quota (PoQ), which is introduced in [Proof of Quota](blend-protocol.md#proof-of-quota).

# Overview

The PoQ ensures that there is a limited number of message encapsulations that a node can perform. This constrains the number of messages a node can introduce to the Blend network. The mechanism regulating these messages is similar to [rate-limiting nullifiers](https://rate-limiting-nullifier.github.io/rln-docs/rln.html).

# Construction

The Proof of Quota (PoQ) verifies that a node's public key is within a limit for either a core node or a leader node. It consists of two parts:

1. Proof of Core Quota (`PoQ_C`): Ensures that the core node is declared and hasn’t already produced more keys than the core quota `Q_C`.
2. Proof of Leadership Quota (`PoQ_L`): Ensures that the leader node would win the proof of stake for **current Cryptarchia epoch** and hasn’t already produced more keys than the leadership quota `Q_L`. That doesn’t guarantee that the node is indeed winning because the PoQ doesn’t check if the note is unspent enabling generation of the proof ahead of time preventing extreme delays.

The final proof `PoQ` is valid if either `PoQ_C` or `PoQ_L` holds.

## Zero-Knowledge Proof Statement

### Public values

A proof attesting that for the following public values derived from blockchain parameters:

```python
class ProofOfQuotaPublic:
    core_quota: int       # Allowed messages per epoch for core nodes (20 bits)
    leader_quota: int     # Allowed messages per epoch for potential leaders (20 bits)
    core_root: zkhash     # Merkle root of zk_id of the core nodes
    K_part_one: int       # First part of the signature public key (16 bytes)
    K_part_two: int       # Second part of the signature public key (16 bytes)
    pol_epoch_nonce: int  # PoL Epoch nonce
    pol_t0: int           # PoL constant t0
    pol_t1: int           # PoL constant t1
    pol_ledger_aged: zkhash # Merkle root of the PoL eligible notes
    # Outputs:
    key_nullifier: zkhash   # derived from epoch, private index and private sk
```

### Witness

The prover knows a witness:

```python
class ProofOfQuotaWitness:
    index: int                            # This is the index of the generated key. Limiting this index limits the maximum number of key generated. (20 bits)
    selector: bool                        # Indicates if it's a leader (=1) or a core node (=0)
    # This part is filled randomly by potential leaders
    core_sk: zkhash                       # sk corresponding to the zk_id of the core node
    core_path: list[zkhash]               # Merkle path proving zk_id membership (len = 20)
    core_path_selectors: list[bool]       # Indicates how to read the core_path (if Merkle nodes are left or right in the path)
    # This part is filled randomly by core nodes
    pol_sl: int                           # PoL slot
    pol_secret_key: int                   # PoL note secret key
    pol_note_value: int                   # PoL note value
    pol_note_tx_hash: zkhash              # PoL note transaction
    pol_note_output_number: int           # PoL note transaction output number
    pol_noteid_path: list[zkhash]         # PoL Merkle path proving noteID membership in ledger aged (len = 32)
    pol_noteid_path_selectors: list[bool] # Indicates how to read the note_path (if Merkle nodes are left or right in the path)
```

Note that every inputs and outputs of zero-knowledge proofs are all scalar field elements.

### Constraints

Such that the following constraints hold:

**Step 1**: The prover selects an `index` for the chosen key. This index must be lower than the allowed quota and not already used. This index is used to derive the key nullifier in step 4. Limiting the possible values of this index also limit the possible nullifier created which produce the desired effect: limiting the generation of keys to a certain quota. `index` will be on 20 bits enabling up to $2^{20}$ messages per node per `epoch`.

**Step 2:**  If the prover indicated that the node is a core node for the proof, the proof checks that:

  1. The core node is registered in the set `N = SDP(epoch)`. This is proven by demonstrating knowledge of a `core_sk` that corresponds to a declared `zk_id`, which is a valid SDP registry for the current `epoch`. The `zk_id` values are stored in a Merkle tree with a fixed depth of 20, with the root provided as a public input. To build the Merkle tree, `zk_id` are ordered from the smallest to the biggest (when seen as natural numbers between 0 and $p$) and remaining empty leaves are represented by the `0` after the sorting (appended at the end of the vector). This structure supports up to 1M validators.
  2. The index is valid: `index < core_quota`.

**Step 3:** If the prover indicated that the node is a potential leader node for the proof, the proof checks that:

  1. The leader node possesses a note that would win a slot in the consensus lottery. Unlike leadership conditions, the proof of quota doesn't verify that the note is unspent. This enables potential provers to generate the PoQ well in advance. All other lottery constraints are the same as in [Circuit Constraints](cryptarchia-proof-of-leadership.md#circuit-constraints).
  2. The index is valid: `index < leader_quota`.

**Step 4:** The prover derives a `key_nullifier` maintained by blend nodes during the epoch for message deduplication purpose.

```python
selection_randomness = zkhash(b"SELECTION_RANDOMNESS_V1", sk, index, validity_period)
key_nullifier = zkhash(b"KEY_NULLIFIER_V1", selection_randomness)
```

  Where `sk` is:

  - The `core_sk` as defined in the [Mantle specification](bedrock-v1.1-mantle-specification.md) if the node is a core node.
  - The secret key of the PoL note if it’s a leader node.

  and `period_nonce` is:

  - The `pol_epoch_nonce` if the node is a core node.
  - The winning slot of the PoL if it’s a leader node.

  Here we use two hashes because the selection randomness is used in the Proof of Selection in order to prove the ownership of a valid PoQ (see [Proof of Selection](blend-protocol.md#proof-of-selection)).

**Step 5**: The prover attaches a one-time signature key used in the blend protocol. This public key is split into two 16-byte parts: `K_part_one` and `K_part_two`. When written in little-endian byte order, the complete public key equals the concatenation `K_part_one||K_part_two`.

### Pseudocode

```python
# Verify selector is a boolean
# selector = 1 if it's a potential leader and 0 if it's a core node
selector * (1 - selector) == 0  # to check that selector is indeed a bit.

# Verify index is lower than quota. It's exactly like saying index < leader_quota
# if selector == 1 or index < core_quota if selector == 0
index < selector * (leader_quota - core_quota) + core_quota

# Check if it's a registered core node
zk_id = zkhash(b"KDF", core_sk)
is_registered = merkle_verify(core_root, core_path, core_path_selectors, zk_id)

# Check if it's a potential leader
is_leader = would_win_leadership(pol_epoch_nonce,
        pol_t0,
        pol_t1,
        pol_ledger_aged,
        pol_sl,
        pol_secret_key,
        pol_sk_secrets_root,
        pol_note_value,
        pol_note_tx_hash,
        pol_note_output_number,
        pol_noteid_path,
        pol_noteid_path_selectors)

# Verify that it's a core node or a leader
assert( selector * (is_leader - is_registered) + is_registered == 1)

# Derive nullifier
selection_randomness = zkhash(
        b"SELECTION_RANDOMNESS_V1",
        selector * (pol_secret_key - core_sk) + core_sk,
        index,
        selector * (pol_sl - pol_epoch_nonce) + pol_epoch_nonce)
key_nullifier = zkhash(b"KEY_NULLIFIER_V1", selection_randomness)
```

## Proof Compression

The proof confirming that the PoQ is correct must be compressed to a size of 128 bytes, where the `UncompressedProof` is comprising of 2  $\mathbb{G}_1$ and 1  $\mathbb{G}_2$ BN256 elements as presented below.

```python
class UncompressedProof:
    pi_a: G1 # BN256 element
    pi_b: G2 # BN256 element
    pi_c: G1 # BN256 element
```

## Proof Serialization

The `ProofOfQuota` structure contains `key_nullifier` and the compressed `proof` transformed in bytes according [**Use in the Logos Blockchain:**](common-cryptographic-components.md). The `key_nullifier` must be transformed into bytes. The bytes of the compressed proof are then concatenated together with the bytes representing the `key_nullifier`, with the encoded `key_nullifier` preceding the encoded compressed `proof`. Reconstruction of a serialized `ProofOfQuota` interpreting the bytes as the concatenation of the `key_nullifier` and of the compressed `proof` following the same rule of conversion.

```python
class ProofOfQuota:
    key_nullifier: zkhash # 32 bytes
    proof: bytes # 128 bytes
```

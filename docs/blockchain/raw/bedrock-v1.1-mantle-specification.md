# Introduction

Mantle is a foundational element of Bedrock, designed to provide a minimal and efficient execution layer that connects together Bedrock Services in order to provide the necessary functionality for Zones. It can be viewed as the system call interface of Bedrock, exposing a safe and constrained set of Operations to interact with lower-level Bedrock services, similar to syscalls in an operating system.

Mantle Transactions provide Operations for Zones and blockchain Services to interact with Bedrock. For example, a Zone sequencer posting an update to Bedrock, or a node operator declaring its participation in the Blend Network, would be done through the corresponding Operations within a Mantle Transaction.

Mantle manages assets using a note-based ledger that follows an UTXO model. Each Mantle Transaction can include Transfer Operation, and any excess balance serves as the fee payment.

# Overview

## Mantle Transaction

The features of the Logos Blockchain are exposed through Mantle Transactions. Each transaction can contain zero or more **Operations**. Mantle Transactions enable users to execute multiple Operations atomically.

## Mantle Operations

Logos Blockchain features are exposed through Mantle Operations, which can be combined and executed together in a single Mantle Transaction atomically. These Operations enable transfers and functions such as on-chain data posting, Cross-Zone interactions, SDP interaction, and leader reward claims.

## Mantle Ledger

The Mantle Ledger enables asset transfers using a transparent UTXO model. While a Transfer Operation can consume more tokens than it creates, the Mantle Transaction excess balance must exactly pay for the fees. The ledger tracks three kinds of notes: regular notes, locked notes (collateral for service declarations) and channel notes (channel bridge funds eligible for PoS participation only).

## Transaction Fees

Mantle Transaction fees are derived from a gas model. The Logos Blockchain has two different gas markets, accounting for permanent data storage, and execution costs. Each Operation has an associated Execution Gas cost. Users can build unbalanced Mantle Transactions to tip the leaders and incentivize the network to include their transaction.

| Gas Market | Charged On | Pricing Basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Execution Gas | Operations | Fixed per Operation |
| Permanent Storage Gas | Signed Mantle Transaction | Proportional to encoded size |

# Mantle Transaction

Mantle Transactions form the core of Mantle, enabling users to combine multiple Operations to access different functions. Each transaction contains zero or more Operations. The system executes all Operations atomically, while using the Mantle Transaction's excess balance—calculated as the difference between the consumed and created value— as the fee payment.

```python
class MantleTx:
    ops: list[Op]

class Op:
    opcode: byte
    payload: bytes

def mantle_txhash(tx: MantleTx) -> Hash:
    tx_bytes = encode(tx)

    h = Hasher()
    h.update(b"MANTLE_TXHASH_V1")
    h.update(tx_bytes)

    return h.digest()
```

The [hash function used](common-cryptographic-components.md), as well as other cryptographic primitives like ZK proofs and signature schemes, are described in [Common Cryptographic Components](common-cryptographic-components.md).

## Mantle Transaction Hash

A Mantle Transaction must include all relevant signatures and proofs for each Operation.

```python
class SignedMantleTx:
    tx: MantleTx
    op_proofs: list[OpProof | None] # each Op has at most 1 associated proof
```

Each proof (op proof and signature) must be cryptographically bound to the `MantleTx` through the `mantle_txhash` to prevent replay attacks. This binding is achieved by including the `MantleTx` hash reduced modulo $`p`$ as a public input in every ZK proof.

```python
mantle_txhash_fr = FiniteField(mantle_txhash, byte_order="little", modulus = p)
```

  `mantle_txhash` is a classical 256-bit hash digest and must be reduced to a field element before being passed to any ZkHasher or used as a ZK public input. We apply a direct modular reduction mod $`p`$ (via `FiniteField(..., modulus=p)`). Since $`p \approx 2^{254}`$, the reduction is slightly non-uniform. This is inconsequential in practice as the collision probability remains around $`2^{-254}`$, and proof binding is derived from the collision-resistance of the classic hash, not from uniformity over $`F_p`$.

## Arithmetic

All arithmetic in this specification is checked. Every addition, subtraction, and multiplication over token values, balances, gas amounts, and fees is performed on the stated integer type, and a Mantle Transaction is invalid if any intermediate or final result cannot be represented in that type; results must never silently wrap around or saturate. Token value computations use the precision of `TokenValue` (see the [Notes](#notes) section). The transaction balance uses a signed 128-bit integer: it can be legitimately negative before the fee check.

The pseudocode expresses these checks with the following helpers; a failed check makes the Mantle Transaction invalid:

```python
UINT64_MAX = 2**64 - 1
INT128_MIN = -2**127
INT128_MAX = 2**127 - 1

def checked_uint64(value: int) -> TokenValue:
        assert 0 <= value <= UINT64_MAX
        return value

def checked_int128(value: int) -> int:
        assert INT128_MIN <= value <= INT128_MAX
        return value
```

Proof of work targets are the deliberate exception. `PowTarget` values are field-sized, and the two difficulty controllers multiply them before dividing: the reward retarget's intermediate product reaches about $`2^{261}`$, and the Blend retarget's radicand about $`2^{487}`$. Those computations are specified over unbounded integers — an implementation must carry them in arbitrary-precision or sufficiently wide arithmetic, and the checked bounds above do not apply to them. What is bounded instead is each controller's *result*, which is capped below the field modulus so that it remains a meaningful threshold.

## Mantle Transaction Fee

The transaction mandatory fee is a sum of two components: the multiplication of the total Execution Gas by the `execution_base_fee`, and the total size of the encoded signed Mantle Transaction multiplied by the `permanent_storage_gas_price`. The execution base fee and the permanent storage gas price are protocol-determined values that are the same for every Mantle Transaction in a block. They are derived following [[Execution Market](execution-market.md) and [Storage Markets](storage-markets.md).

```python
def mandatory_fees(signed_tx: SignedMantleTx,
                   permanent_storage_gas_price: TokenValue, # Given by Storage Market
                   execution_gas_base_price: TokenValue) -> uint64:  # Given by Execution Market
    mantle_tx = signed_tx.tx
    permanent_storage_fees = checked_uint64(len(encode(signed_mantle_tx)) * permanent_storage_gas_price)
    tx_execution_gas = 0

    for op in mantle_tx.ops:
        # Compute how much execution gas of this operation as defined
        # in the gas determination Appendix
        tx_execution_gas += execution_gas(op)
    execution_base_fees = checked_uint64(tx_execution_gas * execution_gas_base_price)

    return checked_uint64(execution_base_fees + permanent_storage_fees)
```

If the Mantle Transaction is unbalanced (meaning that the Transaction consume more value than it creates) and that the leftover balance cover more than the mandatory fees, the remaining is treated as execution tip fees.

## **Validation**

*Given*

```python
signed_tx = SignedMantleTx(
    tx=MantleTx(ops),
    op_proofs
)
```

Mantle validators will ensure the following:

1. We have a proof or a `None` value for each operation.
    ```python
    assert len(op_proofs) == len(ops)
    ```

2. Each Operation is valid, and is executed before the next one is validated.
    ```python
    balance = 0   # Signed 128-bit accumulator: the balance can be legitimately negative

    for op, op_proof in zip(ops, op_proofs):
        assert op.opcode in MANTLE_OPCODES
        # Validated against the state left by the Operations before it.
        validate_mantle_op(mantle_txhash(tx), op.opcode, op.payload, op_proof, state)
        balance = accumulate_balance(balance, op, state)
        execute_mantle_op(op, state)

    def validate_mantle_op(txhash, opcode, payload, op_proof, state):
        if opcode == CHANNEL_INSCRIBE:
            validate_channel_inscribe(txhash, payload, op_proof, state)
        # elif opcode == ...
        #    ...

    def accumulate_balance(balance: int128, op, state) -> int128:
        if op.opcode == TRANSFER:
            for inp in op.inputs:
                balance = checked_int128(balance + get_value_from_note_id(inp, state))
            for out in op.outputs:
                balance = checked_int128(balance - out.value)
        return balance
    ```

3. The Mantle Transaction excess balance pays at least the mandatory fees.
    ```python
    tx_mandatory_fee = mandatory_gas_fees(signed_tx)  # int128
    assert tx_mandatory_fee <= balance
    tx_priority_tip = checked_uint64(balance - tx_mandatory_fee)
    ```

Validation and execution are **interleaved**: each Operation is validated, its contribution to the balance accumulated, and then executed, before the next Operation is validated. Earlier versions of this specification validated every Operation against the pre-transaction state and only then executed them all.

The reason for the change is that a note created by one Operation must be spendable by a later Operation in the same transaction. Under the previous ordering such a note did not exist at the time any Operation was validated, so it could not be referenced, and an Operation that issues a note could not have that note spent to pay the transaction's own fee. Interleaving is what makes that possible, and it is a general property of Mantle rather than one specific to any single Operation.

Interleaving has a second effect, distinct from the one it was introduced for: an Operation validated against a protocol-maintained reserve sees that reserve as the Operations before it have left it. A transaction carrying several claims against the proof of work reward pool therefore has each of them checked against the pool net of its predecessors, rather than all of them checked against the pool as it stood before the transaction began. Under the previous ordering every such claim would have passed a check the pool could not actually satisfy, and the shortfall would have surfaced only as a failed subtraction during execution. This is a consequence of interleaving rather than a reason for it, but it is what makes the pool guard in [CLAIM_POW_REWARD](#claim_pow_reward) sound within a transaction as well as between them.

Two further consequences follow, and both are load-bearing.

The first is that the balance must be **accumulated as the Operations execute** rather than computed from the ledger afterwards. A `TRANSFER` consumes its input notes when it executes, so by the time the last Operation has run those notes are gone and their values can no longer be looked up. Computing the balance after the fact would therefore fail for every transaction that spends anything, not merely for those that spend a note created within the transaction.

The second is an **ordering rule**: a note created by Operation $`i`$ is spendable only by Operations $`j \gt i`$ in the same transaction. An Operation cannot consume a note created later in the same transaction, because it does not yet exist when that Operation is validated, and it cannot consume its own output.

Atomicity is unaffected. The interleaving changes only what each Operation can see; if any Operation fails validation, or the fee check at the end does not hold, the whole transaction is rejected and none of its effects are applied.

## Execution

*Given*

```python
SignedMantleTx(
    tx=MantleTx(ops),
    op_proofs
)
```

Mantle Validators execute each Operation in `ops` according to its opcode, in order, interleaved with validation as described above. An Operation is executed only once the Operations before it have been validated and executed.

## Channel Operations

Channels allow Zones to post their updates on chain. Channels form virtual chains that overlay on top of the Cryptarchia blockchain. Clients and Followers of a Zone can watch its channel to learn the state of that Zone. Each channel has an associated balance, enabling bridging between Zones and Bedrock.

### Message Ordering

Channels form virtual chains by having each message reference its parent message. The order of messages in these channels is enforced by the sequencer by building a hash chain of messages, i.e. new messages reference the previous messages through a parent hash. Given that Cryptarchia has long finality times, these message parent references allow Zone sequencers to continue to post new updates to channels without having to wait for finality. No matter how Cryptarchia forks and reorgs, the channel messages from honest sequencers will eventually be re-included in a way that satisfies the virtual chain order.

The first time a message is sent to an unclaimed channel, the key that signs the initial message becomes the only accredited key in the list (Note that this key may correspond to a threshold signature key). Accredited keys of a channel forms a committee that can configure the channel, withdraw funds and take turns to write messages to that channel following a round-robin algorithm. Configuring a channel includes modifying the list of accredited keys, the round-robin parameters and the required number of signatures to withdraw funds or establish a new configuration.

Validators must maintain the following state to process channel Operations:

```python
channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState] # ChannelId is 32 bytes

class ChannelState:
    # Channel Configuration
    accredited_keys: list[Ed25519PublicKey]  # limited to 65 535 keys
    configuration_threshold: u16  # indicating how many keys are
                                  # required to update the configuration

    # Message Ordering
    tip_hash: hash

    # Decentralized Sequencing
    tip_slot: Slot
    tip_sequencer: u16      # indicating the actual
                            # sequencer position in the list of accredited keys
    tip_sequencer_starting_slot: Slot
    posting_timeframe: u32  # number of slots (0 = infinity)
    posting_timeout: u32    # number of slots (0 = no timeout)

    # Bridging
    transfer_threshold: u16  # indicating how many keys are
                             # required to transfer or withdraw funds from the channel

def default_channel(block_slot: Slot, keys: list[Ed25519PublicKey]) -> ChannelState:
    return ChannelState(
        tip_hash = ZERO,
        tip_slot = block_slot,
        accredited_keys = keys,
        tip_sequencer = 0,
        tip_sequencer_starting_slot = block_slot,
        posting_timeframe = 0,
        posting_timeout = 0,
        configuration_threshold = 1,
        transfer_threshold = 1)
```

Note that the user chooses the ChannelId mapping to the ChannelState (but it’s restricted to 32 bytes). We don't currently impose restrictions on it, but we may do so in the future to prevent undesirable behaviors.

### Decentralized Sequencing

To determine which sequencer is currently authorized to send messages, we use a round-robin algorithm. When a message is posted to a channel, the following algorithm is used to determine who the sequencer is:

```python
# Round Robin algorithm determining the new sequencer index and the
# new sequencer starting slot
def round_robin(block_slot: Slot, channel: ChannelState) -> (u16, u64):
    elapsed_slots = block_slot - channel.tip_slot
    if elapsed_slots >= channel.posting_timeout and channel.posting_timeout != 0:
        # Get the number of sequencers that get timed out
        sequencers_timed_out = elapsed_slots // channel.posting_timeout
        index = (
            (channel.tip_sequencer + sequencers_timed_out)
            % len(channel.accredited_keys)
        )
        starting_slot = (
            channel.tip_slot
            + sequencers_timed_out * channel.posting_timeout
        )
    else:
        # Get the number of timeframes elapsed to get who is the sequencer
        tip_sequencer_duration = block_slot - channel.tip_sequencer_starting_slot
        index = (
            (channel.tip_sequencer + (tip_sequencer_duration // channel.posting_timeframe))
            % len(channel.accredited_keys)
        )
        starting_slot = (
            channel.tip_sequencer_starting_slot
            + (tip_sequencer_duration // channel.posting_timeframe) * channel.posting_timeframe
        )
    return (index, starting_slot)
```

### Bridging

Channels let their bridged funds keep participating in Proof of Stake. When a user deposits funds into a channel, the deposited notes stay on the ledger and are not turned into inert collateral. They are consumed and immediately re-created as channel notes that continue to count toward Proof of Stake and can still be used to create PoLs (see [Channel Notes](#channel-notes)). Two goals motivate this design:

- **More PoS participation, stronger security.** Funds deposited into a channel would otherwise leave the staking set. Keeping them as channel notes means the capital backing the application layer also backs consensus security, so bridging does not shrink the stake that secures the chain.
- **No split between security and application.** A user no longer has to choose between staking funds or using them in a channel. The same funds do both at once. They stay usable inside the channel while still earning Proof of Leadership rewards, so capital is never fragmented between the two.

**Ownership vs. staking power.** A `CHANNEL_DEPOSIT` separates the two rights that a normal note bundles together:

- *Ownership* moves to the channel. The note is registered in the ledger's `channel_notes` set with the channel as its owner, and the channel keeps full control over it. The deposited notes are consumed and re-created identically: they keep their value and `ZkPublicKey`, receive a new `NoteId` derived from the deposit's `OpId`, and are registered as channel-owned. The channel is now the party responsible for the note.
- *Staking power* stays with the `ZkPublicKey` carried by the note. That key does not confer ownership. It only delegates the note's value for PoL creation. Whoever controls the key is the one allowed to turn the note into a PoL and collect the resulting rewards. On deposit this key is still the depositor's, so the user keeps the PoS participation power they had before bridging.

Because the channel owns the note but does not hold the delegated key, the note earns rewards for the key holder, never for the channel itself.

**Ageing.** Because the deposit re-creates the notes under a new `NoteId`, a deposited note restarts the ageing process and must age again before it can create a PoL. Bridged funds still count toward Proof of Stake, so the goals above hold, but the participation is not continuous across the deposit.

**What each party can do.**

| Party | Can | Cannot |
|---|---|---|
| Holder of the note's `ZkPublicKey` (by default, the depositor) | Use the note to create a PoL and earn its leader rewards | Spend the note, withdraw it, reassign it, or use it as service stake |
| Channel sequencers (owner of the note) | Reassign the note to a different `ZkPublicKey` (`CHANNEL_TRANSFER`) and spend it to fund withdrawals (`CHANNEL_WITHDRAW`), both without `ZkSignature` verification | Use the note as service stake, or earn PoL rewards without first assigning the note to their own key |

This makes delegated staking explicit. Sequencers can assign a channel note to their own `ZkPublicKey` and earn the Proof of Leadership rewards it produces, but those rewards always follow the assigned key, so the channel earns nothing merely by owning the note. Conversely, ownership never leaving the channel is exactly what lets sequencers redelegate value or cover withdrawals at any time without a user signature.

**Warning: a deposit is a transfer of custody.** Depositors must understand that channel note handling is fully defined by the channel. Once a `CHANNEL_DEPOSIT` is executed the note belongs to the channel, and its sequencers can reassign it to any `ZkPublicKey` with `CHANNEL_TRANSFER` or release it to whoever they choose with `CHANNEL_WITHDRAW`, at any time and without any signature from the depositor. The ledger enforces no return path to the original depositor. Holding the note's `ZkPublicKey` grants PoS participation power only and never a claim on the value, so it confers no ability to recover the funds. A user who deposits into a dishonest or faulty channel has no on-chain recourse. Deposit only into channels you trust to honour their own withdrawal policy.

### CHANNEL_INSCRIBE

Write a message to a channel with the message data being permanently stored on the Logos Blockchain.

#### Payload

```python
class Inscribe:
    channel: ChannelId       # 32 bytes Channel being written to
    inscription : bytes      # Message to be written on the blockchain
    parent: hash             # Previous message in the channel
    signer: Ed25519PublicKey # Identity of message sender
```

#### Proof

```python
Ed25519Signature
```

#### Execution Gas

  Channel Inscribe Operations have a fixed Execution Gas cost of `EXECUTION_CHANNEL_INSCRIBE_GAS`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values.

#### Validation

  *Given*

```python
txhash: hash
msg: Inscribe
sig: Ed25519Signature

channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]

```
 
  *Validate*

```python
if msg.channel in channels:
    chan = channels[msg.channel]
    current_sequencer_index = round_robin(block_slot, chan)[0]

    # Ensure the signer is the one authorized to write to the channel
    assert msg.signer == chan.accredited_keys[current_sequencer_index]

    # Ensure message is continuing the channel sequence
    assert msg.parent == chan.tip_hash
else:
    # Channel will be created automatically upon execution
    # Ensure that this message is the genesis message (parent == ZERO)
    assert msg.parent == ZERO

# Ensure the msg signer signature
assert Ed25519_verify(txhash, msg.signer, sig)
```

#### Execution

```

  *Execute*

  1. If the channel does not exist, create it just-in-time.
      ```python
      if msg.channel not in channels:
          channels[msg.channel] = default_channel(block_slot, [msg.signer])
      ```

  2. Update the channel sequencer.
      ```python
      chan = channels[msg.channel]
      (new_sequencer_index, new_sequencer_starting_slot) = round_robin(block_slot, chan)

      chan.tip_sequencer_starting_slot = new_sequencer_starting_slot

greeting = Inscription(
    channel=CHANNEL_EARTH,
    inscription=b"Live long and prosper",
    parent=ZERO
    signer=spock_pk
)

# Build the transfer operation to pay the fees
transfer = Transfer(inputs=[<spocks_note_id>], outputs=[<change_note>])

# Wrap it in a transaction
tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=CHANNEL_INSCRIBE, payload=encode(greeting)),
         Op(opcode=TRANSFER, payload=encode(transfer))],
)

# Sign the transaction
signed_tx = SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    op_proofs=[Ed25519_sign(mantle_txhash(tx), spock_sk),
               transfer.prove(spock_sk)]
)

# Send the transaction to the mempool
mempool.push(signed_tx)
```

### CHANNEL_CONFIG

Overwrite the configuration of a channel.

#### Payload

```python
class ChannelConfig:
    channel: ChannelId
    keys: list[Ed25519PublicKey]
    posting_timeframe: u32
    posting_timeout: u32
    configuration_threshold: u16
    transfer_threshold: u16
```

#### Proof

A Channel Config is authorized by a threshold of the channel's accredited keys using [Multiple Ed25519 Signatures Verification](#multiple-ed25519-signatures-verification).

```python
class ChannelConfigOpProof:
    signatures: list[Ed25519Signature] # signatures from configuration_threshold
    indexes: list[u16]  # signatures of accredited keys with their index.
                        # indexes must be ordered from smallest to
                        # biggest without duplication
```

#### Execution Gas

  Channel Config Operations have a linear Execution Gas cost equal to `EXECUTION_CHANNEL_CONFIG_GAS * configuration_threshold`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values.

#### Validation

  *Given*

```python
txhash: zkhash
config: ChannelConfig
proof: ChannelConfigOpProof
channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]
```

  *Validate*

```python
assert config.configuration_threshold > 0
assert config.transfer_threshold > 0
assert len(config.keys) > 0
assert len(config.keys) < 2^16
# The configuration threshold must be reachable with the accredited keys,
# otherwise the channel would be locked out of any future reconfiguration
assert config.configuration_threshold <= len(config.keys)

if config.channel in channels:
    chan = channels[config.channel]
    # Verify the configuration_threshold signatures (see Appendix)
    MultiEd25519_verify(txhash,
                        proof.signatures,
                        proof.indexes,
                        chan.accredited_keys,
                        chan.configuration_threshold)
```

#### Execution

  *Given*

```python
config: ChannelConfig

channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]
block_slot: Slot
```

  *Execute*

  1. If the channel does not exist, create it just-in-time.

      ```python
      if config.channel not in channels:
          channels[config.channel] = default_channel(block_slot, config.keys)
      ```

  2. Update the configuration.

      ```python
      chan = channels[config.channel]

      # Update Channel Configuration Parameters
      chan.accredited_keys = config.keys
      chan.configuration_threshold = config.configuration_threshold

      # Update Decentralized Sequencing Parameters
      chan.tip_sequencer = 0
      chan.tip_sequencer_starting_slot = block_slot
      chan.posting_timeframe = config.posting_timeframe
      chan.posting_timeout = config.posting_timeout

      # Update Bridging Parameters
      chan.transfer_threshold = config.transfer_threshold
      ```

  3. Update the channel tip.

      ```python
      chan = channels[config.channel]
      chan.tip_slot = block_slot
      chan.tip_hash = hash(encode(config))
      ```

#### Example

  Suppose the unique sequencer of Zone A wants to add a key to the list of accredited keys:

```python
# Given a key to add
new_sequencer_pk: Ed25519PublicKey

# The unique sequencer encodes the update and builds the payload
config = ChannelConfig(
    channel=ZONE_A,
    keys=[old_sequencer_pk, new_sequencer_pk],
    posting_timeframe = 5000,
    posting_timeout = 500,
    configuration_threshold = 2,
    transfer_threshold = 1
)

# Build the transfer operation to pay the fees
transfer = Transfer(inputs=[old_sequencer_funds], outputs=[<change_note>])

tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=CHANNEL_CONFIG, payload=encode(config)),
         Op(opcode=TRANSFER, payload=encode(transfer))],
)

signed_tx = SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    op_proofs=[[Ed25519_sign(mantle_txhash(tx), old_sequencer_sk)], [0]],
               transfer.prove(old_sequencer_sk)]
)
```

### CHANNEL_DEPOSIT

Deposit notes to a channel. The inputs are consumed and re-created as channel notes under a new `NoteId`, which resets their ageing and prevents the deposit from being replayed after a withdrawal.

#### Payload

```python
class ChannelDeposit:
    channel: ChannelId
    inputs: list[NoteId]  # the notes to be consumed and re-created as channel notes
    metadata: bytes
```

#### Proof

  A Channel Deposit proves the ownership of the notes being consumed using a [Zero Knowledge Signature Scheme (ZkSignature)](#zero-knowledge-signature-scheme-zksignature).

```python
ZkSignature
```

#### Execution Gas

  Channel Deposit Operations have a fixed Execution Gas cost of `EXECUTION_CHANNEL_DEPOSIT_GAS`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values.

#### Validation

  *Given*

```python
mantle_txhash: zkhash # zkhash of mantle tx containing this ledger tx
deposit: ChannelDeposit
deposit_proof: ZkSignature

channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]

ledger: Ledger
```

  *Validate*

  1. Verify that the channel exist
      ```python
      assert deposit.channel in channels
      ```

  2. Ensure all inputs are spendable and not already channel notes.
      ```python
      ledger.assert_spendable(deposit.inputs)
      ```

  3. Validate ownership over deposited notes.
      ```python
      input_notes = [ledger[input_note_id] for input_note_id in deposit.inputs]
      input_pks = [note.public_key for note in input_notes]
      assert ZkSignature_verify(mantle_txhash, deposit_proof, input_pks)
      ```

#### Execution

  *Given*

```python
deposit: ChannelDeposit

channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]

ledger: Ledger
```

  *Execute*

Consume the inputs and create the same Note with new NoteId as channel notes owned by the channel.

```python
# read the notes that are being moved into the channel
notes_to_add = [ledger[input_note_id] for input_note_id in deposit.inputs]

# consume the inputs, which are regular notes and not registered in channel_notes
ledger.execute_spending(deposit.inputs)

# re-create them as channel notes under a new NoteId
deposit_id = derive_op_id(deposit)
ledger.execute_adding(deposit_id, notes_to_add, deposit.channel)
```

#### Example

  Suppose Alice wants to make a deposit of 50 tokens on Zone A.

```python
# Alice encodes her deposit
deposit = ChannelDeposit(
    channel=ZONE_A,
    inputs=[alice_deposit_note_id]    # This is a note of 50 tokens
    metadata=b"deposit to address: 0x..."
)

# Build the transfer operation to pay the fees
transfer = Transfer(inputs=[Alice_funds], outputs=[<change_note>])


tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=CHANNEL_DEPOSIT, payload=encode(deposit)),
         Op(opcode=TRANSFER, payload=encode(transfer))],
)

signed_tx = SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    op_proofs=[deposit.prove(Alice_sk), transfer.prove(Alice_sk)],
)
```

A Zone that credits a deposit in its own state must be sure the deposit really lands on-chain. If the Zone reflects the deposit through a `CHANNEL_INSCRIBE` posted in a separate Mantle Transaction, a reorganization can reorder the two so that the inscription is included while the deposit is not, leaving the Zone crediting funds it never received. Two options avoid this:

- Wait for the deposit to be finalized before interpreting it, at the cost of the finalization delay.
- Make the inscription conditional on the deposit, by including a `CHANNEL_TRANSFER` that consumes the deposited note in the same Mantle Transaction as the inscription. Mantle Transactions execute atomically, so the inscription is included only if the deposited note exists and is consumed. This removes the waiting period entirely.

The second option resets the ageing of the value. A `CHANNEL_TRANSFER` consumes its inputs and creates new notes, so the resulting note starts the ageing process again and must age before it can create a PoL. A `CHANNEL_DEPOSIT` resets ageing for the same reason, since it consumes its inputs and re-creates them under a new `NoteId`. A `CHANNEL_WITHDRAW` keeps the `NoteId` of the notes it releases and therefore never resets ageing.

### CHANNEL_WITHDRAW

Withdraw notes from a channel.

#### Payload

```python
class ChannelWithdraw:
    channel: ChannelId
    inputs: list[NoteId]
```

#### Proof

A Channel Withdraw is authorized by a threshold of the channel's accredited keys using [Multiple Ed25519 Signatures Verification](#multiple-ed25519-signatures-verification).

```python
class ChannelWithdrawOpProof:
    signatures: list[Ed25519Signature] # exactly transfer_threshold signatures
    indexes: list[int]    # signatures of accredited keys with their index
                          # indexes must be ordered from smallest to
                          # biggest without duplication
```

#### Execution Gas

  Channel Withdraw Operations have a linear Execution Gas cost equal to `EXECUTION_CHANNEL_WITHDRAW_GAS * transfer_threshold`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values.

#### Validation

  *Given*

```python
txhash: zkhash
withdrawal: ChannelWithdraw
proof: ChannelWithdrawOpProof

channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]
ledger: Ledger
```

  *Validate*

  1. Check that the channel exists
      ```python
      assert withdrawal.channel in channels
      ```

  2. Check that the inputs are valid and belongs to the channel
      ```python
      ledger.assert_spendable(withdrawal.inputs, withdrawal.channel)
      ```

  3. Check the signatures (see [Multiple Ed25519 Signatures Verification](#multiple-ed25519-signatures-verification))
      ```python
      MultiEd25519_verify(txhash,
                          proof.signatures,
                          proof.indexes,
                          channels[withdrawal.channel].accredited_keys,
                          channels[withdrawal.channel].transfer_treshold)
      ```

#### Execution

  *Given*

```python
withdrawal: ChannelWithdraw

channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]
ledger: Ledger
```

  *Execute*

Remove the inputs from channel notes owned by the channel. The notes are neither consumed nor re-created: they keep their NoteId, value and ZkPublicKey, and are simply unregistered in the channel_notes set.
```python
for note_id in withdrawal.inputs:
    ledger.channel_notes.pop(note_id)
```
#### Example

  Suppose the unique sequencer of Zone A wants to withdraw 50 tokens.

```python
# Sequencer encodes his withdrawal
withdrawal = ChannelWithdraw(
    channel=ZONE_A,
    inputs  = [Channel_note_id]
)

# Build the transfer operation to pay the fees
transfer = Transfer(inputs=[Sequencer_funds], outputs=[<change_note>])

tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=CHANNEL_WITHDRAW, payload=encode(withdrawal)),
         Op(opcode=TRANSFER, payload=encode(transfer))],
)

signed_tx = SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    op_proofs=[[[Ed25519_sign(mantle_txhash(tx), sequencer_sk)],[0]],
               transfer.prove(Sequencer_node_sk)],
)
```

### CHANNEL_TRANSFER

Assign funds from a channel to new `ZkPublicKey`. This funds are only usable to participate in PoS and to withdraw from the channel.

#### Payload

```python
class ChannelTransfer:
    channel: ChannelId
    inputs: list[NoteId]
    outputs: list[Note]
```

#### Proof

```python
class ChannelTransferOpProof:
    signatures: list[Ed25519Signature] # signature from transfer_threshold keys
    indexes: list[int]    # signatures of accredited keys with their index.
                          # indexes must be ordered from smallest to biggest without duplication
```

#### Execution Gas

`CHANNEL_TRANSFER` Operations have a linear Execution Gas cost equal to `EXECUTION_CHANNEL_TRANSFER_GAS * transfer_threshold`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values.

#### Validation

*Given*

```python
txhash: zkhash
chan_transfer: ChannelTransfer
proof: ChannelTransferOpProof

channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]
ledger: Ledger
```

*Validate*

1. Check that the outputs are valid

```python
ledger.assert_valid_output(chan_transfer.outputs)
```

2. Check that the channel exists

```python
assert chan_transfer.channel in channels
```

```python
ledger.assert_spendable(chan_transfer.inputs, chan_transfer.channel)
```

4. Check the balance

```python
input_amount = checked_uint64(sum(ledger.get_note(input).value for input in chan_transfer.inputs))
output_amount = checked_uint64(sum(output.value for output in chan_transfer.outputs))
assert input_amount == output_amount
```

5. Check the signatures (see [Multiple Ed25519 Signatures Verification](#multiple-ed25519-signatures-verification))
```python
MultiEd25519_verify(txhash,
					proof.signatures,
                    proof.indexes,
                    channels[chan_transfer.channel].accredited_keys,
                    channels[chan_transfer.channel].transfer_treshold)
```

#### Execution

*Given*

```python
chan_transfer: ChannelTransfer

channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]
ledger: Ledger
```

*Execute*

1. Remove inputs from the ledger

```python
ledger.execute_spending(chan_transfer.inputs, chan_transfer.channel)
```

2. Add outputs to the ledger.

```python
chan_transfer_id = derive_op_id(chan_transfer)
ledger.execute_adding(chan_transfer_id, chan_transfer.outputs, chan_transfer.channel)
```

#### Example

```python
# Sequencer encodes their assignation
chan_transfer = ChannelTransfer(
    channel=ZONE_A,
    inputs = [Channel_note_id]
    outputs = [Note(pk=alice, value=50)]
)

# Build the transfer operation to pay the fees
transfer = Transfer(inputs=[Sequencer_funds], outputs=[<change_note>])

tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=CHANNEL_TRANSFER, payload=encode(chan_transfer)),
         Op(opcode=TRANSFER, payload=encode(transfer))],
)

signed_tx = SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    op_proofs=[[[Ed25519_sign(mantle_txhash(tx), sequencer_sk)],[0]],
                              transfer.prove(Sequencer_node_sk)],
)
```

## Service Declaration Protocol (SDP) Operations

These Operations implement the [Service Declaration Protocol](bedrock-service-declaration-protocol.md).

Validators must keep the following state when implementing SDP Operations:

```python
locked_notes: dict[NoteID, LockedNote]
declarations: dict[DeclarationID, DeclarationInfo]

class LockedNote:
    declarations: set[DeclarationID]
```

### Common SDP Structures

```python
class ServiceType(Enum):
    BN="BN" # Blend Network

class Locator(str):
    def validate(self):
        assert len(self) <= 329
        assert validate_multiaddr(self)

class MinStake:
    stake_threshold: int # stake value
    epoch: EpochNumber # epoch number

class ServiceParameters:
    inactivity_period: NumberOfEpochs # number of epochs
    epoch: EpochNumber                # epoch number at which the Service Parameters were set

class DeclarationInfo:
    service: ServiceType
    locators: list[Locator]
    provider_id: Ed25519PublicKey
    zk_id: ZkPublicKey
    locked_note_id: NoteId
    created: EpochNumber
    active: EpochNumber | None
    withdraw_at: EpochNumber | None
    # SDP ops updating a declaration must use monotonically increasing nonces
    nonce: int
```

### SDP_DECLARE

The service registration follows the definition given in [**Declaration Message**](bedrock-service-declaration-protocol.md#declaration-message):

#### Payload

```python
class DeclarationMessage:
    service_type: ServiceType
    locators: list[Locator]
    provider_id: Ed25519PublicKey
    zk_id: ZkPublicKey
    locked_note_id: NoteId
```

Locked notes are introduced in [Locked notes](#locked-notes) and serve as Service collaterals. They cannot be spent before the owner withdraw its participation from the declared service(s).

#### Proof

```python
class DeclarationProof:
    zk_sig: ZkSignature             # signature proving ownership over
                                    # locked note and zk_id
    provider_sig: Ed25519Signature  # signature proving ownership of provider key
```

  see: [Zero Knowledge Signature Scheme (ZkSignature)](#zero-knowledge-signature-scheme-zksignature).

#### Execution Gas

  SDP Declare Operations have a fixed Execution Gas cost of `EXECUTION_SDP_DECLARE_GAS`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values.

#### Validation

  *Given*

```python
txhash: zkhash                  # the txhash of the transaction we are validating
declaration: DeclarationMessage # the declaration we are validating
proof: DeclarationProof

min_stake: MinStake      # the (global) minimum stake setting
ledger: Ledger           # the set of unspent notes
locked_notes: dict[NoteId, LockedNote]
declarations: dict[NoteId, DeclarationInfo]
```

  *Validate*

  The declaration is verified according to [Declare](bedrock-service-declaration-protocol.md#declare).

  1. Ensure ownership over the locked note, `zk_id` and `provider_id`.
      ```python
      assert ZkSignature_verify(
          txhash, proof.zk_sig, [note.public_key, declaration.zk_id]
      )
      assert Ed25519_verify(txhash, proof.provider_sig, provider_id)
      ```

  2. Ensure declaration does not already exist.
      ```python
      assert declaration_id(declaration) not in declarations
      ```

  3. Ensure the locators list is non-empty and has no more than 8 entries.
      ```python
      assert len(declaration.locators) >= 1
      assert len(declaration.locators) <= 8
      ```

  4. Ensure the locked note exists and its value is sufficient for joining the service.
      ```python
      assert ledger.is_unspent(declaration.locked_note_id)
      note = ledger.get_note(declaration.locked_note_id)
      assert note.value >= min_stake.stake_threshold
      ```

  5. Ensure the note has not already been locked for this service.
      ```python
      if declaration.locked_note in locked_notes:
          locked_note = locked_notes[declaration.locked_note]
          services = [declarations[declare_id] for declare_id in locked_note.declarations]
          assert declaration.service_type not in services
      ```

#### Execution

  *Given*

```python
declaration: DeclarationMessage # the declaration we are executing
current_epoch: EpochNumber
locked_notes : dict[NoteId, LockedNote]
```

  *Execute*

  1. Create the locked note state if it doesn't already exist.
      ```python
      if declaration.locked_note not in locked_notes:
          locked_notes[declaration.locked_note_id] = LockedNote(declarations=set())

      locked_note = locked_notes[declaration.locked_note_id]
      ```

  2. Add this declaration to the locked note.
      ```python
      declare_id = declaration_id(declaration)
      locked_note.declarations.add(declare_id)
      ```

  3. Store the declaration as explained in [**Declaration Storage**](bedrock-service-declaration-protocol.md#declaration-storage).
      ```python
      declarations[declare_id] = DeclarationInfo(
          service: declaration.service
          locators: declaration.locators
          provider_id: declaration.provider_id
          zk_id: declaration.zk_id
          locked_note_id: declaration.locked_note_id
          declaration,
          created=current_epoch,
          active=None,
          withdraw_at=None
          nonce=0
      )
      ```

#### Example

```python
# Assume `alice_note` is in the ledger:
alice_note = Utxo(
    txhash=0x2948904F2F0F479B8F8197694B30184B0D2ED1C1CD2A1EC0FB85D299A192A447,
    output_number=3,
    note=Note(value=500, public_key=alice_pk_1),
)

# Alice wishes to lock it to join the Blend network
declaration=DeclarationMessage(
    service_type=ServiceType.BN,
    locators=["/ip4/203.0.113.10/tcp/4001/p2p"],
    provider_id=alice_provider_pk,
    zk_id=alice_pk_2,
    locked_note_id=alice_note.id()
)

# Build the transfer operation to pay the fees
transfer = Transfer(inputs=[fee_note_id], outputs=[])


tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=SDP_DECLARE, payload=encode(declaration)),
         Op(opcode=TRANSFER, payload=encode(transfer))],
)
txhash = mantle_txhash(tx)

declaration_proof = DeclarationProof(
    # proof of ownership of the staked note and zk_id
    zk_sig=ZkSignature([alice_sk_1, alice_sk_2], txhash),
    # proof of ownership of the provider id
    provider_sig=Ed25519Signature(alice_provider_sk, txhash),
)

SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    op_proofs=[declaration_proof, transfer.prove(alice_sk_1)],
)
```

### SDP_WITHDRAW

The service withdrawal follows the definition given in [Withdraw Message](bedrock-service-declaration-protocol.md#withdraw-message).

#### Payload

```python
class WithdrawMessage:
    declaration: DeclarationID
    locked_note_id: NoteId
    nonce: int
```

#### Proof

  A signature from the `zk_id` and the locked note `pk` attached to the declaration is required for withdrawing from a service, (see [Zero Knowledge Signature Scheme (ZkSignature)](#zero-knowledge-signature-scheme-zksignature)).

```python
ZkSignature
```

#### Execution Gas

  SDP Withdraw Operations have a fixed Execution Gas cost of `EXECUTION_SDP_WITHDRAW_GAS`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values.

#### Validation

  *Given*

```python
txhash: zkhash # Mantle transaction hash of the tx containing this operation
withdraw: WithdrawMessage
signature: ZkSignature

ledger: Ledger
locked_notes: dict[NoteId, LockedNote]
declarations: dict[DeclarationID, DeclarationInfo]
```

  *Validate*

  1. Ensure that the locked note exists, is locked and bound to this declaration.
      ```python
      assert ledger.is_unspent(withdraw.locked_note_id)
      assert withdraw.locked_note_id in locked_notes

      locked_note = locked_notes[withdraw.locked_note_id]

      assert withdraw.declaration in locked_note.declarations
      ```

  2. Validate SDP withdrawal according to [**Withdraw**](bedrock-service-declaration-protocol.md#withdraw).
      1. Ensure declaration exists.
          ```python
          assert withdraw.declaration in declarations
          declare_info = declarations[withdraw.declaration]
          ```
      2. Ensure the declaration is not already scheduled for withdrawal.
          ```python
          assert declare_info.withdraw_at is None
          ```
      3. Ensure locked note `pk` and `zk_id` attached to this declaration authorized this Operation.
          ```python
          locked_note = ledger[withdraw.locked_note_id]
          assert ZkSignature_verify(txhash, signature, [locked_note.pk, declare_info.zk_id])
          ```
      4. Ensure that the nonce is greater than the previous one.
          ```python
          assert withdraw.nonce > declare_info.nonce
          ```

#### Execution

  *Given*

```python
withdraw: WithdrawMessage
signature: ZkSignature

current_epoch: EpochNumber # current epoch
ledger: Ledger
locked_notes: dict[NoteId, LockedNote]
declarations: dict[DeclarationID, DeclarationInfo]
```

  *Execute*

  Executes the withdrawal protocol [**Withdraw**](bedrock-service-declaration-protocol.md#withdraw).

  Withdrawal only records the intent: `withdraw_at` is set to the current
  (withdrawal) epoch `e`, the node's last rewardable epoch. The declaration is
  removed and its stake unlocked at epoch `e+2` by the
  [SDP Epoch Finalization](#sdp-epoch-finalization) step, right after the final
  reward is paid out.

  1. Update the declaration info with the nonce and the withdrawal epoch.
      ```python
      declare_info = declarations[withdraw.declaration]
      declare_info.nonce = withdraw.nonce
      declare_info.withdraw_at = current_epoch
      ```

#### Example

```python
withdraw=Withdraw(
    declaration=alice_declaration_id,
    locked_note_id=alices_locked_note_id
    nonce=1579532
)

# Build the transfer operation to pay the fees
transfer = Transfer(inputs=[alices_locked_note_id],
                    outputs=[Note(100, alice_note_pk)])

tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=SDP_WITHDRAW, payload=encode(withdraw)),
         Op(opcode=TRANSFER, payload=encode(transfer))],
)

SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    # proof ownership of the withdrawn note and zk id
    op_proofs=[ZkSignature_sign([alice_note_sk, alice_sk], mantle_txhash(tx)),
               transfer.prove(alice_sk)]
)
```

### SDP Epoch Finalization

Withdrawn declarations are removed by Mantle as part of the epoch transition,
not when the `WithdrawMessage` is processed. A node that withdrew in epoch `e`
has `withdraw_at == e`, and its last rewardable epoch is `e`; the epoch-`e`
rewards are distributed in the first block of epoch `e+2` (see
[Service Reward Distribution Protocol](bedrock-service-reward-distribution.md)).
In that same first block, **after** the rewards have been distributed, every
declaration whose final reward has been paid out (`withdraw_at <= current_epoch - 2`)
is removed and its stake unlocked. Performing the removal after the reward
distribution guarantees a declaration is never removed before its final reward
is paid. Declarations that withdrew without earning a final reward are removed
by the same step, so their stake is always released.

  *Given*

```python
current_epoch: EpochNumber
locked_notes: dict[NoteId, LockedNote]
declarations: dict[DeclarationID, DeclarationInfo]
```

  *Execute*

  For every `declare_id`, `declare_info` in `declarations` where
  `declare_info.withdraw_at is not None and declare_info.withdraw_at <= current_epoch - 2`:

  1. Remove the declaration from its locked note.
      ```python
      locked_note = locked_notes[declare_info.locked_note_id]
      locked_note.declarations.remove(declare_id)
      ```

  2. Remove the declaration.
      ```python
      del declarations[declare_id]
      ```

  3. Unlock the note once it is no longer bound to any declaration.
      ```python
      if len(locked_note.declarations) == 0:
          del locked_notes[declare_info.locked_note_id]
      ```

### SDP_ACTIVE

The service active action follows the definition given in [Active Message](bedrock-service-declaration-protocol.md#active-message).

#### Payload

```python
class Active:
    declaration: DeclarationID
    nonce: int
    metadata: bytes # a service-specific node activeness metadata
```

#### Proof

```python
ZkSignature
```

#### Execution Gas

  SDP Active Operations have a fixed Execution Gas cost of `EXECUTION_SDP_ACTIVE_GAS`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values.

#### Validation

  *Given*

```python
txhash: zkhash # Mantle transaction hash of the tx containing this operation
active: Active
signature: ZkSignature

declarations: dict[DeclarationID, DeclarationInfo]
```

  *Validate*

```python
assert active.declaration in declarations
declaration_info = declarations[active.declaration]

assert active.nonce > declaration_info.nonce

assert ZkSignature_verify(txhash, signature, declaration_info.zk_id)
```

#### Execution

  Executes the active protocol [Active](bedrock-service-declaration-protocol.md#active). The activation, i.e. setting the `declaration.active`, is handled by the service-specific logic.

#### Example

```python
active=Active(
    declaration=alice_declaration_id,
    nonce=1579532,
    metadata=b"Look, I am still doing my job"
)

# Build the transfer operation to pay the fees
transfer = Transfer(inputs=[fee_note_id], outputs=[])

tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=SDP_ACTIVE, payload=encode(active))],
)
txhash = mantle_txhash(tx)

SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    op_proofs=[Ed25519_sign(txhash, validator_sk), transfer.prove(fee_note_sk)]
)
```

## Leader Operations

### LEADER_CLAIM

This Operation claims the leader's block reward anonymously.

#### Payload

```python
class ClaimRequest:
    rewards_root: zkhash # Merkle root used in the proof for voucher membership
    voucher_nf: zkhash
    public_key: ZkPublicKey
```

#### Proof

  The provider proves that they have won a proof of Leadership before the start of the current epoch, i.e., their reward voucher is indeed in the voucher set: [Proof of Claim](#proof-of-claim).

#### Execution gas

  Leader Claim Operations have a fixed Execution Gas cost of `EXECUTION_LEADER_CLAIM_GAS`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values.

#### Validation

  *Given*

```python
mantle_txhash: zkhash
claim : ClaimRequest
last_voucher_root: zkhash # The last root of the voucher Merkle tree
                          # at the start of the epoch
voucher_nullifier_set: set[zkhash]
proof: ProofOfClaim
```

  *Validate*

```python
assert claim.voucher_nf not in voucher_nullifier_set
assert claim.rewards_root == last_voucher_root
validate_proof(claim, proof, mantle_txhash)
```

#### Execution

  *Given*

```python
claim: ClaimRequest

ledger: Ledger
voucher_nullifier_set: set[zkhash]
leaders_rewards: TokenValue   # The pool of tokens to be claim by leaders
leader_reward: TokenValue     # The amount one leader can claim
```

  *Execution*

  1. Add `claim.voucher_nf` to the `voucher_nullifier_set`.
  2. Denoting by `leader_reward` the amount defined for leader rewards in [Leaders Reward](bedrock-anonymous-leaders-reward.md#leaders-reward), construct a single output note with value leader_reward under the public key defined in the payload, and insert it into the Ledger:
      ```python
      output_note=Note(
          value = leader_reward
          public_key = claim.public_key,
      )
      claim_id = derive_op_id(claim)
      ledger.execute_adding(claim_id, [output_note])
      ```

  3. Reduce the leader’s reward `leaders_rewards` value by the same amount (without ZK proof).

#### Example

```python
secret_voucher = 0xDEADBEAF;
reward_voucher = leader_claim_voucher(secret_voucher)
voucher_nullifier = leader_claim_nullifier(secret_voucher)

claim=ClaimRequest(
    rewards_root=REWARDS_MERKLE_TREE.root(),
    voucher_nf=voucher_nullifier,
    public_key=leader_one_time_key
)

# Build the transfer operation to pay the fees
transfer = Transfer(inputs=[<fee_note>], outputs=[<change_note>])

tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=LEADER_CLAIM, payload=encode(claim)),
         Op(opcode=TRANSFER, payload=encode(transfer))],
)

claim_proof = claim.prove(
    secret_voucher,
    REWARDS_MERKLE_TREE.path(leaf=reward_voucher),
    mantle_txhash(tx)
)

SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    op_proofs=[claim_proof, transfer.prove(fee_note_sk)]
)
```

## Proof of Work Operations

Validators must maintain the following state to process proof of work Operations:

```python
pow_reward_pool: TokenValue      # Reserve the rewards are paid from
epoch_pow_reward: TokenValue     # sigma_e: reward per claim, fixed for the epoch
difficulty_reward: PowTarget     # d_reward: the reward threshold, retargeted every block
pow_nullifiers: set[zkhash]      # Spent solutions, retained for the acceptance window
block_slots: dict[hash, SlotNumber]  # Slots of recently seen blocks, for the window check
```

`PowTarget` is a scalar field element. A puzzle ticket is accepted when it is strictly below the target, so a **smaller** target is a **harder** puzzle.

The reward pool is a reserve of tokens the protocol pays claims from. It is seeded once at genesis and refilled at each epoch boundary from a share of the fees collected over the previous epoch, as specified in [Reward Pool](#reward-pool). It is not minted on demand: a claim transfers tokens that already exist into circulation, and cannot be executed if the pool cannot cover it.

### Window of Acceptance

A claim references a recent block by hash. The reference is checked against the slot of the block including the claim, so that a solution cannot be presented arbitrarily long after it was found:

```python
EXPECTED_BLOCKS_PER_WINDOW: uint64 = 10   # W_b: window depth, in expected blocks

def accept_claim_pow_op(claim: ClaimPowRewardOp, current_slot: SlotNumber) -> bool:
    block = get_block_from_hash(claim.block_hash)   # None if unknown or not canonical
    if block is None:
        return False
    return 0 <= current_slot - block.slot <= WINDOW
```

The window is measured in slots, but it is **specified in blocks** and derived from the slot activation coefficient $`f`$ given in [Constants](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#constants):

$$
\mathrm{WINDOW} = \left\lfloor \frac{W_b}{f} \right\rfloor
$$

With $`W_b = 10`$ and $`f = 1/30`$ this is $`300`$ slots.

The derivation matters more than the number. What the window bounds is staleness, and staleness is a property of how far the chain has moved on, not of elapsed time. Only $`f`$ relates the two: a slot count fixed independently of it would silently come to mean a different number of blocks whenever the block rate were retuned, tightening or loosening the check without anyone changing it. Expressing the window as a block depth keeps its meaning stable under that change, and states the quantity a reader actually needs — how many blocks deep a claim's anchor may be — rather than one they would have to convert.

Because block production is a lottery, $`W_b`$ is an expectation rather than a bound. A run of empty slots means fewer than $`W_b`$ blocks fall inside the window, and a dense run means more.

The window also bounds how long nullifiers must be retained. A solution referencing a block that has aged out of the window is rejected by this check regardless of whether its nullifier is still held, so nullifier entries may be discarded once their referenced block leaves the window. Retention is therefore proportional to $`W_b`$, and enlarging the window enlarges every validator's nullifier set in proportion.

Because `get_block_from_hash` resolves against the canonical chain, a claim whose referenced block is reorganised out becomes invalid. A claim already propagated but not yet included may therefore stop being includable, and must be re-mined against a block that is still canonical. Note that $`W_b`$ is far shallower than the security parameter $`k`$, so a block inside the window is not yet immutable and this case is expected rather than exceptional.

### CLAIM_POW_REWARD

This Operation claims a reward from the proof of work reward pool by presenting a puzzle solution.

#### Payload

```python
class ClaimPowRewardOp:
    epoch_nonce: zkhash        # Epoch nonce the solution was found against
    block_hash: hash           # Recent canonical block the solution is anchored to
    public_key: ZkPublicKey    # Key the reward note is paid to
```

The puzzle ticket is derived from the payload:

```python
def get_puzzle_ticket(claim: ClaimPowRewardOp) -> zkhash:
    return zkhash(
        claim.epoch_nonce,
        FiniteField(claim.block_hash, byte_order="little", modulus=p),
        claim.public_key,
    )
```

where $`p`$ is the scalar field modulus given in [Common Cryptographic Components](common-cryptographic-components.md). A miner searches for a `public_key` whose ticket falls below the reward threshold; the corresponding secret key is what allows the reward note to be spent afterwards. The secret key must be sampled with full entropy rather than enumerated, because it both remains secret and authorises spending the reward.

Note that this derivation carries no domain separation tag.

#### Proof

  `None`. This Operation carries no signature and no zero-knowledge proof. The authorisation is the puzzle solution itself, which is re-derived from the payload and checked during validation. The corresponding entry in `op_proofs` is `None`.

#### Execution gas

  Claim Operations have a fixed Execution Gas cost of `EXECUTION_CLAIM_POW_REWARD_GAS`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values. It is paid as part of the transaction's normal fee, which is typically settled from the reward note itself.

#### Validation

  *Given*

```python
claim: ClaimPowRewardOp            # the CLAIM_POW_REWARD payload
                                   # op_proof is None for this Operation

current_slot: SlotNumber           # slot of the block including this claim
difficulty_reward: PowTarget       # d_reward, retargeted every block
pow_nullifiers: set[zkhash]        # spent solutions, retained for WINDOW
pow_reward_pool: TokenValue
epoch_pow_reward: TokenValue       # sigma_e
```

  *Validate*

```python
# 1. Claiming must be enabled for this block: the pool must be able to cover a reward.
assert epoch_pow_reward > 0
assert pow_reward_pool >= epoch_pow_reward

# 2. The referenced block must be canonical and within the acceptance window.
assert accept_claim_pow_op(claim, current_slot)

# 3. The solution must have been found against the current epoch.
assert claim.epoch_nonce == get_current_epoch_nonce()   # the Cryptarchia epoch nonce

# 4. The ticket must satisfy the reward threshold.
puzzle_ticket = get_puzzle_ticket(claim)
assert puzzle_ticket < difficulty_reward

# 5. The solution must not have been claimed before. The nullifier is the ticket,
#    so the value computed in step 4 is reused.
assert puzzle_ticket not in pow_nullifiers
```

  The nullifier of a claim is its puzzle ticket, which is determined by the payload and unique to a winning key:

```python
def pow_nullifier(claim: ClaimPowRewardOp) -> zkhash:
    return get_puzzle_ticket(claim)
```

  This Operation performs no fee or balance check of its own. The transaction's fee is settled at the transaction level as normal.

  The first condition is what prevents the pool being drawn negative, and its two clauses fail in different circumstances. `epoch_pow_reward > 0` fails once the pool has fallen, over many epochs, below the point where the division in [Reward Pool](#reward-pool) rounds down to zero. `pow_reward_pool >= epoch_pow_reward` fails when the pool has been drained within a single epoch to less than one reward, which is possible because the reward is held fixed for the epoch while the pool it is paid from shrinks with every claim. Both are evaluated per claim, against the pool as it stands at that point in the block, so claiming stops the moment either fails and resumes only when the condition holds again. [Reward Pool](#reward-pool) sets out what each requires and how claiming recovers.

  The epoch nonce in step 3 is the Cryptarchia epoch nonce $`\eta`$ defined in [Epoch Nonce](cryptarchia-v1-protocol.md#epoch-nonce), the same value the consensus lottery uses. A claim built against any other epoch is rejected, so a solution is usable only within the epoch it was found in and must be re-mined afterwards.

  Note that this does not make a solution unpredictable in advance. The epoch nonce is fixed part way through the *preceding* epoch and is public from that moment, so solutions for an epoch can be computed before it begins. What bounds a solution's age is the acceptance window on `block_hash`, which is $`W_b`$ blocks deep and therefore far tighter than an epoch.

#### Execution

  *Given*

```python
claim: ClaimPowRewardOp

ledger: Ledger
pow_reward_pool: TokenValue
epoch_pow_reward: TokenValue       # sigma_e, fixed for the epoch
pow_nullifiers: set[zkhash]
```

  *Execution*

  1. Add `pow_nullifier(claim)` to the `pow_nullifiers` set, so the solution cannot be claimed again. The entry is retained until the claim's referenced block leaves the acceptance window.
  2. Construct a single output note of value `epoch_pow_reward` under the public key given in the payload, and insert it into the Ledger:
      ```python
      output_note = Note(
          value = epoch_pow_reward,
          public_key = claim.public_key,
      )
      claim_id = derive_op_id(claim)
      ledger.execute_adding(claim_id, [output_note])
      ```

  3. Reduce the `pow_reward_pool` by the same amount:
      ```python
      pow_reward_pool = checked_uint64(pow_reward_pool - epoch_pow_reward)
      ```

  This mirrors `LEADER_CLAIM`: a single output note of a protocol-determined value, inserted with no zero-knowledge proof of any input, with the source pool decremented by the same amount.

#### Example

A miner searches for a key whose ticket clears the reward threshold, then spends the resulting note to pay the fee of the very transaction that creates it. No tokens are required beforehand.

```python
# Mine against a recent canonical block and the current epoch nonce.
block_hash   = recent_canonical_block_hash()
epoch_nonce  = get_current_epoch_nonce()
reward_sk, reward_pk = pow_search(block_hash, epoch_nonce, difficulty_reward)

claim = ClaimPowRewardOp(
    epoch_nonce=epoch_nonce,
    block_hash=block_hash,
    public_key=reward_pk,
)

# The reward note's id is known before submission, because epoch_pow_reward is
# fixed for the epoch and the payload determines the Operation id.
claim_id       = derive_op_id(claim)
reward_note    = Note(value=epoch_pow_reward, public_key=reward_pk)
reward_note_id = derive_note_id(claim_id, 0, reward_note)

# A following TRANSFER spends that note to pay the fee and keep the change.
transfer = Transfer(inputs=[reward_note_id], outputs=[change_note])

tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=CLAIM_POW_REWARD, payload=encode(claim)),
         Op(opcode=TRANSFER,         payload=encode(transfer))],
)

SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    op_proofs=[None,                       # authorisation is the solution in the payload
               transfer.prove(reward_sk)],
)
```

This is what makes a claim **self-funding**, and it works only because of two properties established elsewhere in this specification. The reward amount is fixed for the whole epoch, so the note's value — and therefore its identifier — can be computed before the transaction is submitted. And validation is interleaved with execution, so by the time the `TRANSFER` is validated the note it spends already exists.

Both properties are required. If the reward varied within the epoch the wallet could not name the note in advance, and if validation ran entirely before execution the note would not exist when the `TRANSFER` was checked.

### Reward Pool

The reward per claim is a fixed fraction of the pool, divided by the number of claims an epoch is expected to accept:

```python
EPOCH_POW_DISTRIBUTION_RATE_NUM: uint64 = 1     # rho, as a fraction NUM / DEN
EPOCH_POW_DISTRIBUTION_RATE_DEN: uint64 = 100
TARGET_CLAIMS_PER_BLOCK: uint64 = 10      # T
EXPECTED_BLOCKS_PER_EPOCH: uint64         # N_b

def compute_epoch_pow_reward(pow_reward_pool: TokenValue) -> TokenValue:
    denominator = (EPOCH_POW_DISTRIBUTION_RATE_DEN
                   * TARGET_CLAIMS_PER_BLOCK
                   * EXPECTED_BLOCKS_PER_EPOCH)
    return (pow_reward_pool * EPOCH_POW_DISTRIBUTION_RATE_NUM) // denominator
```

`TARGET_CLAIMS_PER_BLOCK` is the same value the reward difficulty steers toward, so the two uses are consistent by construction: the reward is sized for the rate the controller is targeting.

Its value does not determine how much an epoch distributes. As shown below, an epoch running at the target rate pays out the fraction $`\rho`$ of the pool whatever the target is, so the target divides a fixed amount into a chosen number of parts rather than setting the amount. What it determines is how much of that amount survives being divided.

Every claim pays a transaction fee out of the reward it receives, so of the amount an epoch distributes, a part equal to the target times the fee is immediately returned as fees and only the remainder reaches a claimant. Writing $`\beta`$ for the pool's share of the fees collected and $`n`$ for the transactions a block carries, the amount an epoch delivers net of those fees is proportional to $`\beta n - T`$. **The target subtracts from what the mechanism delivers, at whatever share is chosen.** Raising it does not spread the same benefit more widely; it spreads a smaller benefit more widely, and at $`T = \beta n`$ the reward per claim falls to the fee, nothing reaches anyone, and claiming stops.

The target is therefore set as low as the remaining consideration allows, which is variance. The relative variation in a Poisson count of `T` is $`1/\sqrt{T}`$, so a low target makes the number of claims a given block carries erratic. That variation is absorbed by the difficulty controller and affects which blocks carry claims rather than what a claim is worth: the per-claim reward is fixed for the whole epoch and does not depend on how many claims any one block happens to contain.

The target is set to 10, at which a block's claim count varies by about a third. At the specified share of a tenth of the fees collected, on a block of six hundred transactions, this leaves about four fifths of the distribution reaching claimants; the same share at a target of 50 would sit at break-even, with the claims' own fees consuming essentially all of it. Claims occupy roughly one percent of a full block at this target, so they do not compete for block space with ordinary traffic.

It is stated as an absolute count rather than as a proportion of the transactions a block actually carries. A proportion would let claim throughput follow demand, and would keep the reward per claim in a fixed relation to the fee at any level of usage; it would also make the target vary block by block, which the reward computation above and the controller below both assume it does not. The absolute form is specified here.

At each epoch boundary, before any block of the new epoch is processed, the pool is credited with the refill accrued over the previous epoch and the per-claim reward is then recomputed from the refilled pool:

```python
POW_SHARE: uint64 = 10                    # beta, as the fraction POW_SHARE / SHARE_DEN
SHARE_DEN: uint64 = 100

def on_epoch_boundary(epoch_blocks: list[Block]):
    pow_reward_pool = checked_uint64(pow_reward_pool + get_pow_pool_refill(epoch_blocks))
    epoch_pow_reward = compute_epoch_pow_reward(pow_reward_pool)
```

`get_pow_pool_refill` sums, over the blocks of the epoch that just ended, the fraction `POW_SHARE / SHARE_DEN` of the fees each block collected, as specified in [Proof of Work Reward Pool](overview-cryptoeconomics.md#proof-of-work-reward-pool). Those tokens are diverted from the fee burn rather than minted, so refilling the pool never adds to the supply; who bears the cost of the diversion is set out in that section, and depends on where the emission model's blend of minting and recycling sits.

The share is set to a tenth, and it is bounded from both directions. From below, the reward must exceed the fee by enough margin that a claim is worth making and that the tip a block builder recovers on its own claims is not a material advantage, which by the relation above requires the share to be at least twice the target claim rate divided by the transactions a block carries. From above, [Cryptoeconomics](overview-cryptoeconomics.md#who-bears-the-cost-of-the-diversion) shows that in the mature network the diversion is borne by the Blend service and the leaders, so the share is a claim on the funding of the privacy layer and consensus, and proof of work is intended to be an entry path rather than a competitive alternative to them. A tenth leaves the mining share at rather less than a third of the leader share while giving a reward several times the fee at the traffic levels the fee market is designed around. Setting it to zero disables refilling and leaves the pool to run down from its genesis seed alone.

All arithmetic here is checked, in accordance with [Arithmetic](#arithmetic). The pool must not saturate: saturating at the maximum representable value would create tokens that were never allocated, which is precisely the failure the checked-arithmetic rule exists to prevent.

Fixing the reward for the whole epoch is what allows a wallet to compute a reward note's identifier before submitting a claim, and therefore what makes a self-funding claim possible at all. The pool is drawn down by claims within the epoch, but the per-claim value is not recomputed until the next boundary.

#### Exhaustion within an epoch

**The distribution rate is not a spending cap.** $`\rho`$ divides the pool by the number of claims an epoch is *expected* to accept; it does not limit how many are accepted. Nothing stops a block from carrying more claims than the target, and nothing stops an epoch from paying out more than the fraction $`\rho`$ of its pool. Claims are paid, one after another, for as long as the pool can cover the next one, and are rejected from the moment it cannot.

The rejection is not a special case. It is the first condition of [Validation](#claim_pow_reward) above, evaluated for every claim against the pool as it stands at that point in the block, so a block may contain claims that were accepted followed by claims that were rejected, and a claim that fails only because the pool is exhausted is simply an invalid Operation and its transaction is rejected whole.

Exhausting the pool this way requires the claim rate to exceed the target by a factor of $`1/\rho`$ for a whole epoch, because a claim pays $`\rho`$ of the pool divided by the target claim count. At the values specified here that is `TARGET_CLAIMS_PER_BLOCK` divided by $`\rho`$, or a thousand claims in every block for seven and a half days, against a `MAX_BLOCK_TXS` of 1024. **It is therefore only just out of reach rather than impossible by construction**, and what keeps it out of reach is the reward difficulty controller, which would have to be defeated by two orders of magnitude and held there for the whole epoch. The condition exists so that if that ever happens the result is that claiming stops, rather than that the pool goes negative or the protocol pays out tokens it does not hold.

Claiming recovers by itself. At the next epoch boundary the refill is credited and `epoch_pow_reward` is recomputed from the refilled pool, so a pool that was drained to a fraction of one reward yields a correspondingly smaller reward in the epoch that follows, and claiming resumes at that lower value. The mechanism degrades to a smaller reward rather than stopping permanently, and it stops permanently only when the pool falls so far that the recomputed reward rounds down to zero.

Because the payout at the target claim rate is $`T \cdot N_b \cdot \sigma_e`$, and $`\sigma_e`$ is the pool's fraction $`\rho`$ divided by $`T \cdot N_b`$, an epoch running at the target rate distributes exactly the fraction $`\rho`$ of the pool, whatever the target rate is set to. The target claim rate therefore governs how many participants share the epoch's distribution and how much each receives, not how much is distributed in total.

`EPOCH_POW_DISTRIBUTION_RATE` is set to a hundredth. It does not determine the reward: as shown below, the level the reward settles at contains no $`\rho`$ at all. What it sets is **the size of the standing reserve**, because the pool settles where the refill and the payout balance, which is at $`1/\rho`$ epochs' worth of distribution. A hundredth therefore means the pool holds about a hundred epochs of distribution — some two years — permanently.

Three things argue for a larger $`\rho`$ and one for a smaller. Larger reduces the reserve held out of circulation, reduces the genesis endowment needed to clear the floor below, and shortens the lag with which the reward follows a change in fee revenue, all in the same proportion. Smaller widens the margin against the pool being drained within a single epoch, which by [Exhaustion within an epoch](#exhaustion-within-an-epoch) takes `TARGET_CLAIMS_PER_BLOCK` divided by $`\rho`$ claims in every block. At a hundredth that is a thousand claims per block against a `MAX_BLOCK_TXS` of 1024, so the static margin is thin; halving $`\rho`$ would make it unreachable outright but would double the reserve, the endowment floor and the lag, to guard against a case the difficulty controller already prevents and whose failure is in any event graceful. Doubling $`\rho`$ instead would put the drain within reach of blocks half full of claims, which is not acceptable. A hundredth is where those pressures meet, and is the value the proposal gives.

`POW_REWARD_POOL_GENESIS` is set to **five thousandths of the supply at network launch**. Its constraints and the relationship the three parameters must satisfy are given below and in [Genesis](#genesis).

The relationship the three must satisfy is that a claim's reward exceeds its fee. Two of them fix where the reward settles, and the third fixes how long it takes to get there.

Left alone, the pool converges: each epoch it gains the refill and loses the fraction $`\rho`$ it distributes, so it approaches the level at which the two balance, and there the reward per claim is simply the refill divided by the number of claims the epoch is expected to accept. Since the refill is the share $`\beta`$ of the fees the epoch collected, and those fees are the number of transactions times the fee each pays, the settled reward per claim is $`\beta`$ times the fees one block collects, divided by `TARGET_CLAIMS_PER_BLOCK`. The distribution rate $`\rho`$ cancels out of this: it sets how fast the pool converges and how much of the pool is paid out in any one epoch, not the level the reward settles at.

Comparing that against the fee a claim itself pays, and taking every transaction in a block to pay a comparable fee, the reward covers the fee once a block carries at least `TARGET_CLAIMS_PER_BLOCK` divided by $`\beta`$ transactions. At the specified target of 10 and share of a tenth, that point is about one hundred and twenty transactions per block, and the reward is twice the fee at about two hundred and forty and five times the fee at six hundred.

**The share and the claim target are not independent**: holding the margin fixed, the share required is proportional to the target. They must be chosen together against the traffic the network is expected to sustain, and the target should be chosen first and low, because for any given share it subtracts directly from what the mechanism delivers.

Below that level of traffic the pool pays out more than it takes in and draws down toward the settled level from above. Starting it above that level is what the genesis endowment is for: it buys a period during which the reward exceeds the fee even though the fee inflow alone would not sustain it. `POW_REWARD_POOL_GENESIS` and $`\rho`$ together set how long that period lasts.

### Genesis

The pool is seeded once, at genesis, with `POW_REWARD_POOL_GENESIS`, as specified in [Bedrock Genesis Block](bedrock-genesis-block.md). After that it changes only through the epoch-boundary refill and through claims.

The seed is **five thousandths of the supply at network launch**. Two floors bound it from below. The first is the pool size at which a claim stops covering its own fee, which is the fee multiplied by the target claim rate and the blocks in an epoch, divided by $`\rho`$; nothing smaller is a working endowment at all. The second is larger and is what actually decides the value: the pool must stay above that floor for as long as it takes the fee inflow to grow into sustaining the reward by itself, and since the pool drains at $`\rho`$ throughout that period, a slower arrival of traffic costs disproportionately more. Five thousandths covers an adoption path reaching full blocks over ten years several times over, and sustains claiming for close to five years even if the network carries no traffic at all.

It is stated as a fraction of the launch supply rather than as a quantity of base units because that is the form in which it is a decision about how the initial supply is divided, which is what it is. The opening reward per claim follows from the fraction, $`\rho`$ and the target claim rate alone.

Whether that reward is generous enough is a separate question, and it is settled by the **price level the two fee markets are initialised at**, since the fee a claim pays is its size and gas multiplied by those prices. A seed of five thousandths yields an opening reward that exceeds twice the claim's fee for as long as the launch fee is at or below $`1.157 \times 10^{-10}`$ of the launch supply; the constraint is stated as a fraction of supply so that it survives any future revision of the supply. At the supply sized in [Block Rewards](block-rewards.md) and the fee markets' resting prices, a claim's fee is $`2.22 \times 10^{-11}`$ of supply, so the condition holds with a factor of five in hand and the opening reward is about ten times the fee. A larger seed relaxes the constraint in proportion.

The seed is drawn from the initial token distribution rather than minted. This is what keeps claiming outside the protocol's emission envelope: the seed consists of tokens that exist from genesis, and the refill of fees that were paid and would otherwise have been burnt, so claiming redirects tokens rather than creating them. It never raises issuance above what the emission model would otherwise allow.

### Reward Difficulty

`difficulty_reward` is part of consensus state and is updated **every block**, steering the number of accepted claims toward `TARGET_CLAIMS_PER_BLOCK`. It is independent of the Blend threshold used by [Proof of Quota](proof-of-quota.md), which is a per-epoch value and is never evaluated here.

```python
EMA_SMOOTHING_FACTOR: uint64 = 9      # F, the weight given to the previous estimate
EMA_SMOOTHING_PRECISION: uint64 = 10  # P, the scale F is expressed against; F < P

def compute_new_reward_difficulty(claims_in_block: uint64,
                                  current_target: PowTarget) -> PowTarget:
    # The demand implied by this block, reconstructed from the target that
    # produced it, then smoothed against the target rate. Floored at 1 so the
    # division below is always defined, including when no claims arrived.
    demand = max(1, (EMA_SMOOTHING_PRECISION - EMA_SMOOTHING_FACTOR) * claims_in_block
                    + EMA_SMOOTHING_FACTOR * TARGET_CLAIMS_PER_BLOCK)
    new_target = (TARGET_CLAIMS_PER_BLOCK * current_target
                  * EMA_SMOOTHING_PRECISION) // demand
    # Capped so that converting back into the field cannot reduce modulo p and
    # turn a very easy target into a very hard one.
    return min(new_target, p - 1)
```

The controller holds no state of its own beyond the current target. Rather than remembering a running estimate of demand, it reconstructs one from the target in force, on the assumption that the target was calibrated to the intended rate. This is what keeps it a single value in consensus state.

Two properties follow, and both matter for its safety. When a block accepts exactly the target number of claims the target is unchanged, so the intended rate is a fixed point. When a block accepts none, the numerator is floored at 1 and the target moves up by a factor of $`P/F`$ — bounded, and in the direction of making claiming easier, so a period without claims cannot lock the mechanism. The smoothing means a single unusual block moves the target only slightly, so no separate per-block clamp is required.

The rate the controller observes is the rate of claims **included in blocks**, not the rate at which solutions are found. Solutions that are never included, because a block builder declined to include them or because block space was exhausted, are invisible to it. Difficulty therefore tracks accepted demand rather than offered demand, and the two diverge when block space is contended.

A block builder may include its own claims. The controller makes this self-correcting: claims a builder awards itself raise the observed rate like any other, which tightens the target and raises the work required for every subsequent claim, including the builder's own.

#### Choosing the smoothing and the genesis target

The smoothing is nine parts in ten, matching the exponential moving average the execution market uses for the same reason. The ratio is what sets both of the properties above: at the target rate the response has slope $`F/P`$, which is below one and therefore stable, with a time constant of about ten blocks; at zero claims it has slope $`P/F`$, which is above one, so the no-claims state pushes away rather than trapping. Any pair with $`F \lt P`$ preserves both signs, so the choice sets how fast the controller responds rather than whether it is stable, and nine in ten places the response an order of magnitude slower than the block rate — fast enough to track a change in hashrate within minutes, slow enough that one unusual block barely moves the target.

`difficulty_reward` is set at genesis to the scalar field modulus divided by $`2^{26}`$. The value matters much less than it appears to, because it is only the seed of a controller that re-derives the target every block, and **its error is asymmetric**. Setting it too permissive over-pays: the first blocks accept more than the target, and the excess is bounded by how quickly the controller tightens, which for an initial value a hundredfold too permissive comes to some twelve hundred extra claims over about twenty blocks — in aggregate about six thousandths of one percent of the genesis pool. Setting it too hard costs only time: with no claims arriving the target rises by a factor of $`P/F`$ each block, so an initial value a hundredfold too hard corrects itself within an hour and nothing is lost.

Since being wrong in one direction costs tokens and in the other costs minutes, the genesis value is chosen on the hard side. At $`2^{26}`$ a solution is around twenty-five minutes of work on one core, so reaching the target claim rate requires several hundred cores of honest mining across the whole network — deliberately more than a launch is likely to attract, so that the controller's first move is to loosen. It is set independently of the Blend threshold, and more conservatively, because the two answer different questions: one is the price of a message, the other only the seed of a controller that will correct it within the hour.

### Blend Difficulty

`difficulty_blend` is the threshold used by the proof of work branch of [Proof of Quota](proof-of-quota.md) to admit messages to the Blend network. It is consensus state and is maintained here, alongside the reward difficulty, because it must be agreed by every node and is derived from on-chain observations. It is never evaluated by any Operation.

The two difficulties are independent. They gate different things, are computed from different observations, and neither implies the other: a solution may satisfy one, both, or neither. Coupling them would force one objective to distort the other, since they are steering unrelated quantities.

Unlike the reward difficulty, `difficulty_blend` is recomputed **once per epoch**, at the boundary, and held fixed for the whole epoch. This is required rather than a simplification: the value is a public input to the proof, so a value that changed within an epoch would partition that epoch's proofs into distinguishable classes and leak which participants produced which messages.

The control objective is transaction load, for the anonymity-set reason given in [Blend Difficulty](blend-protocol.md#blend-difficulty). At the reference load the threshold sits at a baseline; above it admission tightens, below it admission loosens.

```python
BLEND_DIFFICULTY_BASE: PowTarget = p // 2**22   # Threshold at the reference load
TARGET_TXS_PER_BLOCK: uint64 = 512              # Reference transactions per block
BLEND_DAMPING_NUM: uint64 = 1                   # a, where the exponent is alpha = a / b
BLEND_DAMPING_DEN: uint64 = 2                   # b, with 0 < a <= b so that alpha <= 1
BLEND_MAX_STEP: uint64 = 2                      # Max factor the threshold may move per epoch

def compute_epoch_blend_difficulty(epoch_blocks: list[Block],
                                   previous: PowTarget) -> PowTarget:
    # Observed load as an exact ratio, never divided: num == den at the reference load.
    num = sum(num_transactions(b) for b in epoch_blocks)
    den = TARGET_TXS_PER_BLOCK * len(epoch_blocks)

    lo = previous // BLEND_MAX_STEP
    # Capped below the field modulus for the same reason as the reward retarget:
    # a target at or above p is no threshold at all, since every ticket is a
    # field element and would satisfy it.
    hi = min(previous * BLEND_MAX_STEP, p - 1)

    if num == 0:
        return hi   # No load observed: as permissive as this epoch's clamp allows.

    # A smaller target is harder, so load divides the baseline:
    #     target = BASE / load ** alpha
    # Every quantity is an integer and only the final root is floored, so the
    # result is at most one unit away from the exact value.
    a, b = BLEND_DAMPING_NUM, BLEND_DAMPING_DEN
    radicand = (BLEND_DIFFICULTY_BASE ** b * den ** a) // num ** a
    return clamp(integer_nth_root(radicand, b), lo, hi)
```

Applied once at the boundary, before any block of the new epoch is processed.

The upper clamp is capped at $`p-1`$ in addition to the per-epoch step bound. Without the cap, an idle network — every epoch observing no load and returning `hi` — would double the threshold each epoch and pass the field modulus after a few months of empty epochs, at which point every ticket would satisfy it and admission would be free. The reward controller bounds its result for the same reason, and the two failure modes are the same one.

Raising `difficulty_blend` shrinks the anonymity set, so an adversary able to drive it up could degrade privacy for everyone. Three properties bound that.

The input is the **mean over a whole epoch**, so moving it requires paying fees to inflate transaction counts across every block of the epoch rather than spiking one. The response is **sub-linear**: with $`\alpha \le 1`$, and at $`\alpha = 1/2`$ in particular, quadrupling the load only doubles the threshold, so each additional attacker-funded transaction buys less effect than the last while costing the same. And the **per-epoch clamp** bounds movement to a factor of `BLEND_MAX_STEP` in either direction, so even sustained pressure moves the value gradually and honest participants have at least an epoch to react.

The attack must therefore be paid for continuously while its effect stays bounded and gradual. This is the opposite trade-off from the reward difficulty, which may move every block precisely because its input is cheap to measure, self-correcting, and carries no privacy consequence.

Note what this controller cannot see. Its input is transactions included in blocks, so messages that are never included — including messages sent purely to consume Blend capacity — do not raise it. It regulates admission against observed chain load, not against network load, and is therefore not by itself a defence against flooding the Blend network with messages that never reach a block.

#### Choosing the four constants

`TARGET_TXS_PER_BLOCK` is the load at which the threshold sits at its baseline, and is set to half of `MAX_BLOCK_TXS`. This mirrors the execution market, which steers toward half its per-block gas limit: a block at the fee market's own target is the natural definition of ordinary load, and defining the reference any other way would leave the two markets disagreeing about what busy means.

The damping exponent is a half, as one over two. The argument for it is the one given above — quadrupling the load only doubles the threshold, so each additional attacker-funded transaction buys less effect than the last while costing the same as the first.

`BLEND_MAX_STEP` is two. At a damping exponent of a half, a factor of two in the threshold corresponds to a factor of four in load, so the clamp does not bind on ordinary variation and engages only on swings larger than that within a single epoch. A sustained hundredfold change in load is tracked over four epochs, which is a month; that is slow enough that participants can react and fast enough that the threshold is not left badly wrong for long.

`BLEND_DIFFICULTY_BASE` is the one with no anchor elsewhere in this specification tree, because it fixes what a message ought to *cost*, and nothing states that. It is therefore set from the work itself, against a measurement of that work.

A candidate solution derives a public key and then a ticket, which is two `zkhash` invocations. Each of those absorbs its inputs and a padding element through a sponge of width three, so a two-input hash is three permutations and a candidate is six — or four, if a miner precomputes the state following each hash's constant first input. Measured against the reference implementation on one core of a current machine, a candidate costs a little over twenty microseconds, and precomputing those prefixes improves it by only about forty percent.

At a threshold of the scalar field modulus divided by $`2^{22}`$, one solution is about four million candidates, which is around a minute and a half of a single core. Since one solution admits exactly one message, a participant with a single core and no stake can send on the order of nine hundred messages a day, and needs no tokens to do it. Below about $`2^{20}`$ the work ceases to be a meaningful cost; above about $`2^{26}`$ that same participant manages a message every half hour, which is not an on-ramp. The chosen value sits between those.

**The machine the measurement was taken on is not the machine this is for.** The figures above come from a current desktop-class processor, whereas the intended deployment target is a small single-board computer of the Raspberry Pi 5 class, whose cores run at roughly half the clock and materially lower throughput on the multiply-and-carry sequences that field arithmetic is made of. Four to eight times slower per core is the plausible range, and it has not been measured. At the middle of that range a message costs closer to ten minutes of one core than to the minute and a half the threshold was chosen for, and matching the intended cost on such a machine would put the threshold some three exponents lower. **This value should be re-derived against a measurement on the target hardware before it is relied upon**, and the question of whether the reference is a single core or the whole board, which differs by a factor of four, settled with it.

Two further limits on the measurement. It was taken against an implementation that uses no assembly and no batching, so a determined miner using a faster one should expect a lower cost by an amount that has not been measured; the forty percent figure above bounds only the *algorithmic* headroom, not the implementation headroom.

`difficulty_blend` is set to `BLEND_DIFFICULTY_BASE` at genesis, so the network begins at its reference load rather than at a guess about the first epoch's traffic.

#### What the threshold does not bound

It sets a price per message; it does not set a ceiling on the rate. A participant able to bring a large amount of computation to bear obtains solutions in proportion to it, and at any threshold cheap enough to serve as an on-ramp that rate exceeds the honest one by orders of magnitude. Raising the threshold to prevent this would put the on-ramp out of reach of the participants it exists for, and would still not bound an adversary willing to spend more.

What bounds the damage is elsewhere: verification of the proof of quota before relaying rather than after, so an invalid message is dropped at the first hop rather than propagated; the nullifier cache, which must be sized against $`d_{blend}`$ rather than against a count of registered nodes; and the fact that the work must be paid for continuously, in energy, for as long as the flood is to be sustained. The threshold is one term in that, not the whole of it.

## TRANSFER

Transactions must prove the ownership of spent notes. In classical blockchains, this is done through a signature. To stay compatible with our architecture, the signature is done by a ZK proof (see [Zero Knowledge Signature Scheme (ZkSignature)](#zero-knowledge-signature-scheme-zksignature)), proving the knowledge of the secret key associated with the public key.

Transactions allow complete transaction linkability and the public key spending the note is not hidden.

### Payload

```python
class Transfer:
    inputs: list[NoteId]  # the list of consumed note identifiers
                          # must be non-empty
    outputs: list[Note]
```

### Proof

  A Transfer proves the ownership of the consumed notes using a [Zero Knowledge Signature Scheme (ZkSignature)](#zero-knowledge-signature-scheme-zksignature).

```python
ZkSignature
```

### Execution Gas

  Transfer have a fixed Execution Gas cost of `EXECUTION_TRANSFER_GAS`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values.

### Validation

  *Given*

```python
mantle_txhash: zkhash # zkhash of mantle tx containing this ledger tx
transfer: Transfer
transfer_proof: ZkSignature

ledger: Ledger
```

  *Validate*

  1. Ensure all inputs are spendable and not in a channel.
      ```python
      ledger.assert_spendable(transfer.inputs)
      ```

  2. Validate transfer proof to show ownership over input notes.
      ```python
      input_notes = [ledger[input_note_id] for input_note_id in transfer.inputs]
      input_pks = [note.public_key for note in input_notes]
      assert ZkSignature_verify(mantle_txhash, transfer_proof, input_pks)
      ```

  3. Ensure outputs are valid.
      ```python
      ledger.assert_valid_output(transfer.output)
      ```

### Execution

  *Given*

```python
transfer: Transfer
transfer_proof: ZkSignature

ledger: Ledger
```

  *Execution*

  1. Remove inputs from the ledger.
      ```python
      ledger.execute_spending(transfer.inputs)
      ```

  2. Add outputs to the ledger.
      ```python
      transfer_id = derive_operation_id(transfer)
      ledger.execute_adding(transfer_id, transfer.outputs)
      ```

### Example

```python
alice_note_id = ... # assume Alice holds a note worth 501 tokens
bob_note=Note(
    value=500
    public_key=bob_pk,
)

transfer = Transfer(
    inputs=[alice_note_id],
    outputs=[bob_note],
)
```

# Mantle Ledger

## Notes

Notes are composed of two fields representing their value and their owner:

```python
class Note:
    value: TokenValue   # uint64
    public_key: ZkPublicKey # 32 bytes
```

### Denomination

**One LGO is the smallest amount the protocol can represent, transfer or price.** `TokenValue` counts whole LGO, and there is no finer unit: every quantity of that type — note values, balances, fees, prices and pool balances — is an integer number of LGO.

An indivisible token is workable only because the supply is sized against the fee schedule. Both fee markets price in whole LGO per byte and per unit of gas and can never go below one, so the cost of a transaction as a fraction of everything that exists is fixed by the supply, and [Block Rewards](block-rewards.md) sizes `S_tge` so that a block at the fee market's target utilisation burns approximately what a block mints at the maximum emission rate. Against the earlier, much smaller supply the same fee schedule made an ordinary transaction cost several parts in ten million of the whole supply and a claim cost more than the reward pool could ever hold; the resolution was to scale the supply rather than subdivide the token, the two being arithmetically equivalent.

`TokenValue` is a 64-bit unsigned integer, so the largest representable amount is $`2^{64}-1 \approx 1.84 \times 10^{19}`$ LGO, and the sized supply of $`3 \times 10^{14}`$ occupies it with a margin of about sixty thousand — room for far longer than the protocol's maximum emission rate could ever use.

One consequence is accepted knowingly: the maximum minted block reward derived in [Block Rewards](block-rewards.md), $`625000000/219`$ LGO, is not a whole number, and is rounded down wherever an integer is required. At the sized supply that rounding loses one part in ten million of the reward; against the earlier supply the same rounding lost one part in seven hundred, which is part of why the supply and not the unit was the right thing to change.

The genesis reward pool is given as a fraction of the launch supply in [Genesis](#genesis), so that its size scales with any future revision of the supply automatically.

### Note Id

A note can be uniquely identified by the Operation that created it and its output number: `(op_id, output_number)` if each Operation are uniquely identifiable. For this reason, every Operation that output notes have a unique payload that is used to derive the Operation identifier. Because it is often useful to have a commitment to the note fields for use in ZK proofs (e.g., for PoL), we included the note in the note identifier derivation.

```python
def derive_op_id(operation: Op) -> Hash:
    op_bytes = encode(op)
    h = Hasher() # /!\ This is a classic hash not a zkhash /!\
    h.update(b"OPERATION_ID_V1")
    h.update(op_bytes)
    return h.digest()

def derive_note_id(op_id: Hash, output_number: int, note: Note) -> NoteId:
    return zkhash(
        FiniteField(b"NOTE_ID_V1", byte_order="little", modulus= p),
        FiniteField(op_id, byte_order="little", modulus= p),
        FiniteField(output_number, byte_order="little", modulus= p),
        FiniteField(note.value, byte_order="little", modulus= p),
        note.public_key
    )
```

`op_id` is a classical 256-bit hash digest and must be reduced to a field element before being passed to the ZkHasher. We apply a direct modular reduction mod `p` (via `FiniteField(..., modulus=p)`). Since $`p \approx2^{-254}`$, the reduction is slightly non-uniform, values in $`[0, 2^{256} \mod p)`$ appear one extra time, but this is inconsequential in practice: the collision probability remains around $`2^{-254}`$, and `NoteId` uniqueness is not derived from uniformity of `op_id` over $`𝔽_p`$ but from the collision-resistance of the underlying hash and per-operation payload uniqueness.

These note identifiers uniquely define notes in the system and cannot be chosen by the user. Nodes maintain the set of notes through a dictionary mapping the NoteId to the note.

### Locked notes

Locked notes are special notes in Mantle that serve as collateral for Service Declarations. A note can become locked after executing a Declare Operation, preventing it from being spent until explicitly released through a Withdraw Operation. The system maintains a mapping of locked note IDs to their supporting declarations. Though locked, these notes remain in the Ledger and can still participate in Proof of Stake. When service providers withdraw all their declarations, the associated note(s) become unlocked and available for spending again.

### Channel Notes

Channel notes are on-ledger notes minted to represent channel funds. They are distinct from Locked Notes as they can’t be used to declare a service. However, they follow the same ageing rule as ordinary notes since they are part of the ledger and can be used for PoL creation once aged enough.

The system maintains a `channel_notes` set in the Ledger tracking all active channel `NoteId` and their respective `ChannelId`.

## Ledger

```python
class Ledger:
    notes: list[Note]
    locked_notes: dict[NoteId, LockedNote]
    channel_notes: dict[NoteId, ChannelId]
```

### Input Notes Spendability Validation

A note is spendable if and only if it exists, it is not spent or locked. The following function validates that an input of notes can be consumed:

```python
class Ledger:
    def assert_spendable(inputs: list[NoteId], channel_id: ChannelId | None):
		# Assert inputs are empty
		assert len(inputs) > 0

        ## Check there is no duplicate
        assert len(inputs) == len(set(inputs))

            # Check that each note is individualy not locked, for the correct channel and unspent
            for note_id in inputs:
                assert ledger.is_unspent(note_id)
                assert note_id not in locked_notes
                if channel_id is None:
                	assert note_id not in ledger.channel_notes
                else:
                	assert note_id in ledger.channel_notes
                    assert ledger.channel_notes[note_id] == channel_id
```

### Output Notes Validation

Before an output of notes can be inserted into the Ledger, every note field must satisfy the following constraints:

```python
class Ledger:
    def assert_valid_output(outputs: list[Note]):
        for note in outputs:
            assert note.value > 0
            assert note.value <= 2**64-1
```

### Consuming Input Notes Execution

Consuming a set of notes removes them from the Ledger’s Merkle tree and recycles their leaf indices:

```python
class Ledger:
    def execute_spending(inputs: list[NoteId], channel_id: ChannelId | None):
        for note_id in inputs:
            # updates the merkle tree to zero out the leaf for this entry
            # and adds that leaf index to the list of unused leaves
            ledger.remove(note_id)
            if channel_id is not None:
                ledger.channel_notes.pop(note_id)
```

### Creating Output Notes Execution

Creating notes derives their `NoteId` from the Operation’s `OpId` and insert them in the Ledger:

```python
class Ledger:
    def execute_adding(op_id: Hash, outputs: list[Note], channel_id: ChannelId | None):
        for (output_index, output_note) in enumerate(outputs):
            output_note_id = derive_note_id(op_id, output_index, output_note)
            ledger.add(output_note_id)
            if channel_id is not None:
                ledger.channel_notes[output_note_id] = channel_id
```

`EXECUTION_CLAIM_POW_REWARD_GAS` is the cost of an Operation that verifies no proof and no signature: it re-derives a hash, compares it against a threshold, and performs a few lookups and insertions. It is priced with the other Operations whose cost is a single signature verification, which is a conservative over-estimate here, and is derived in [\[Analysis\] Gas Cost Determination](analysis-gas-cost-determination.md).

The value bounds the fee a claim transaction must pay, and therefore bears on whether a claim is worth making at all: a claim whose fee exceeds its reward is never submitted.

## Zero Knowledge Signature Scheme (ZkSignature)

A proof attesting that for the following public values:

```python
class ZkSignaturePublic:
    public_keys: list[ZkPublicKey] # public keys signing the message (len = 32)
    msg: zkhash # a finite field element uniquely representing the message
```

The prover knows a witness:

```python
class ZkSignatureWitness:
    # The list of secret keys used to signed the message
    secret_keys: list[ZkSecretKey] # (len = 32)
```

Such that the following constraints hold:

- The number of secret keys is equal to the number of public keys.
  ```python
  assert len(secret_keys) == len(public_keys)
  ```

- Each public key is derived from the corresponding secret key.
  ```python
  assert all(
      notes[i].public_key == zkhash(FiniteField(b"KDF", byte_order="little", modulus= p), secret_keys[i])
      for i in range(len(public_keys))
  )
  ```

- The proof is bound to `msg` (it’s the `mantle_tx_hash` reduced modulo $`p`$ in case of transactions).

  For implementation, the ZkSignature circuit will take a maximum of 32 public keys as inputs. To prove ownership of fewer keys, the remaining inputs will be padded with the public key corresponding to the secret key `0` and ignored during execution. The outputs have no size limit since they are included in the hashed message.

## Multiple Ed25519 Signatures Verification

Several operations (e.g. [Channel Configuration](#channel-configuration) and
[Channel Withdraw](#channel-withdraw)) authorize an action with a threshold of
Ed25519 signatures produced by a list of accredited keys. Each signature comes
with the index, in the accredited keys list, of the key that produced it. The
verification is factored out in the following routine:

*Given*

```python
msg: zkhash                        # the message being signed (the mantle txhash)
signatures: list[Ed25519Signature]
indexes: list[u16]                 # for each signature, the index in `keys` of
                                   # the signing key
keys: list[Ed25519PublicKey]       # the accredited keys
threshold: u16                     # the number of required signatures
```

*Verify*

```python
def MultiEd25519_verify(msg, signatures, indexes, keys, threshold):
    # There must be exactly one index per signature
    assert len(signatures) == len(indexes)

    # There must be exactly `threshold` signatures
    assert len(signatures) == threshold

    # Indexes must be ordered from smallest to biggest without duplication.
    # Being strictly increasing rejects duplicates and, since `idx` is used to
    # index `keys`, guarantees every index stays within bounds.
    for i in range(len(indexes) - 1):
        assert indexes[i] < indexes[i + 1]

    # Each signature must be valid for the accredited key at its index
    for sig, idx in zip(signatures, indexes):
        assert Ed25519_verify(msg, keys[idx], sig)
```

## Proof of Claim

A proof attesting that given these public values:

```python
class ProofOfClaimPublic:
    voucher_root: zkhash # Merkle root of the reward_voucher maintained by everyone
    voucher_nullifier: zkhash
    mantle_tx_hash_fr: zkhash # attached hash reduced modulo p
```

The prover knows the following witness:

```python
class ProofOfClaimWitness:
    secret_voucher: zkhash
    voucher_merkle_path: list[zkhash]
    voucher_merkle_path_selectors: list[bool]
```

such that the following constraints hold:

- The reward voucher is derived from the secret voucher.
```python
assert reward_voucher == zkhash(
    FiniteField(b"REWARD_VOUCHER", byte_order="little", modulus= p),
    secret_voucher)
```

- There exists a valid Merkle path from the reward voucher as a leaf to the Merkle root.
```python
assert voucher_root == path_root(leaf=reward_voucher,
    path=voucher_merkle_path,
    selectors=voucher_merkle_path_selectors)
```

- The voucher nullifier is derived from the secret voucher correctly.
```python
assert voucher_nullifier == zkhash(
    FiniteField(b"VOUCHER_NF", byte_order="little", modulus= p),
    secret_voucher)
```

- The proof is bound to the `mantle_tx_hash` reduced modulo $`p`$.

# Introduction

Mantle is a foundational element of Bedrock, designed to provide a minimal and efficient execution layer that connects together Bedrock Services in order to provide the necessary functionality for Zones. It can be viewed as the system call interface of Bedrock, exposing a safe and constrained set of Operations to interact with lower-level Bedrock services, similar to syscalls in an operating system.

Mantle Transactions provide Operations for Zones and blockchain Services to interact with Bedrock. For example, a Zone sequencer posting an update to Bedrock, or a node operator declaring its participation in the Blend Network, would be done through the corresponding Operations within a Mantle Transaction.

Mantle manages assets using a note-based ledger that follows an UTXO model. Each Mantle Transaction can include Transfer Operation, and any excess balance serves as the fee payment.

# Overview

## Mantle Transaction

The features of the Logos Blockchain are exposed through Mantle Transactions. Each transaction can contain zero or more **Operations**. Mantle Transactions enable users to execute multiple Operations atomically: the Operations are applied one after the other in the order they appear, and either all of them take effect or none does.

## Mantle Operations

Logos Blockchain features are exposed through Mantle Operations, which can be combined in a single Mantle Transaction and executed atomically. These Operations enable transfers and functions such as on-chain data posting, Cross-Zone interactions, SDP interaction, and leader reward claims.

## Mantle Ledger

The Mantle Ledger enables asset transfers using a transparent UTXO model. While a Transfer Operation can consume more tokens than it creates, the Mantle Transaction excess balance must exactly pay for the fees. The ledger tracks three kinds of notes: regular notes, service notes (collateral for service declarations) and channel notes (channel bridge funds eligible for PoS participation only).

## Transaction Fees

Mantle Transaction fees are derived from a gas model. The Logos Blockchain has two different gas markets, accounting for permanent data storage, and execution costs. Each Operation has an associated Execution Gas cost. Users can build unbalanced Mantle Transactions to tip the leaders and incentivize the network to include their transaction.

| Gas Market | Charged On | Pricing Basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Execution Gas | Operations | Fixed per Operation |
| Permanent Storage Gas | Signed Mantle Transaction | Proportional to encoded size |

# Mantle Transaction

Mantle Transactions form the core of Mantle, enabling users to combine multiple Operations to access different functions. Each transaction contains zero or more Operations. The system executes the Operations atomically, while using the Mantle Transaction's excess balance, calculated as the difference between the consumed and created value, as the fee payment.

```python
class MantleTx:
    ops: list[Op]

class Op:
    opcode: byte
    payload: bytes

def mantle_txhash(tx: MantleTx) -> Hash:
    tx_bytes = encode(tx)

    h = Hasher()
    h.update(b"MANTLE_TXHASH_V1")
    h.update(tx_bytes)

    return h.digest()
```

The [hash function used](common-cryptographic-components.md), as well as other cryptographic primitives like ZK proofs and signature schemes, are described in [Common Cryptographic Components](common-cryptographic-components.md).

## Mantle Transaction Hash

A Mantle Transaction must include all relevant signatures and proofs for each Operation.

```python
class SignedMantleTx:
    tx: MantleTx
    op_proofs: list[OpProof | None] # each Op has at most 1 associated proof
```

Each proof (op proof and signature) must be cryptographically bound to the `MantleTx` through the `mantle_txhash` to prevent replay attacks. This binding is achieved by including the `MantleTx` hash reduced modulo $`p`$ as a public input in every ZK proof.

```python
mantle_txhash_fr = FiniteField(mantle_txhash, byte_order="little", modulus = p)
```

  `mantle_txhash` is a classical 256-bit hash digest and must be reduced to a field element before being passed to any ZkHasher or used as a ZK public input. We apply a direct modular reduction mod $`p`$ (via `FiniteField(..., modulus=p)`). Since $`p \approx 2^{254}`$, the reduction is slightly non-uniform. This is inconsequential in practice as the collision probability remains around $`2^{-254}`$, and proof binding is derived from the collision-resistance of the classic hash, not from uniformity over $`F_p`$.

## Arithmetic

All arithmetic in this specification is checked. Every addition, subtraction, and multiplication over token values, balances, gas amounts, and fees is performed on the stated integer type, and a Mantle Transaction is invalid if any intermediate or final result cannot be represented in that type; results must never silently wrap around or saturate. Token value computations use the precision of `TokenValue` (see the [Notes](#notes) section). The transaction balance uses a signed 128-bit integer: it can be legitimately negative before the fee check.

The pseudocode expresses these checks with the following helpers; a failed check makes the Mantle Transaction invalid:

```python
UINT64_MAX = 2**64 - 1
INT128_MIN = -2**127
INT128_MAX = 2**127 - 1

def checked_uint64(value: int) -> TokenValue:
        assert 0 <= value <= UINT64_MAX
        return value

def checked_int128(value: int) -> int:
        assert INT128_MIN <= value <= INT128_MAX
        return value
```

## Mantle Transaction Fee

The transaction mandatory fee is a sum of two components: the multiplication of the total Execution Gas by the `execution_base_fee`, and the total size of the encoded signed Mantle Transaction multiplied by the `permanent_storage_gas_price`. The execution base fee and the permanent storage gas price are protocol-determined values that are the same for every Mantle Transaction in a block. They are derived following [[Execution Market](execution-market.md) and [Storage Markets](storage-markets.md).

```python
def mandatory_fees(signed_tx: SignedMantleTx,
                   permanent_storage_gas_price: TokenValue, # Given by Storage Market
                   execution_gas_base_price: TokenValue) -> uint64:  # Given by Execution Market
    mantle_tx = signed_tx.tx
    permanent_storage_fees = checked_uint64(len(encode(signed_tx)) * permanent_storage_gas_price)
    tx_execution_gas = 0

    for op in mantle_tx.ops:
        # Compute how much execution gas of this operation as defined
        # in the gas determination Appendix
        tx_execution_gas += execution_gas(op)
    execution_base_fees = checked_uint64(tx_execution_gas * execution_gas_base_price)

    return checked_uint64(execution_base_fees + permanent_storage_fees)
```

If the Mantle Transaction is unbalanced (meaning that the Transaction consume more value than it creates) and that the leftover balance cover more than the mandatory fees, the remaining is treated as execution tip fees.

## **Validation**

*Given*

```python
signed_tx = SignedMantleTx(
    tx=MantleTx(ops),
    op_proofs
)

permanent_storage_gas_price: TokenValue # Given by Storage Market
execution_gas_base_price: TokenValue    # Given by Execution Market
```

The state validation reads is not a fixed snapshot: it advances as the block is processed. A Mantle Transaction is validated against the state left by the Mantle Transactions preceding it in the block, as defined in [Block Proposal Validation](bedrock-v1.1-block-construction.md#block-proposal-validation), and validation and execution then follow one another Operation by Operation, in the order the Operations appear: the Operation at index `i` is validated against the state the Operations at indices `0` to `i-1` left, then executed to produce the state the Operation at index `i+1` is validated against. This is what the `ledger`, `channels`, `service_notes`, `declarations` and `voucher_nullifier_set` given to each Operation below denote.

Atomicity is what a failed check means, not simultaneity. If any of the checks below fails, the whole Mantle Transaction is invalid: none of its Operations takes effect, whether or not it was reached. An invalid Mantle Transaction is never skipped over either, the block including it being invalid and nothing of that block being executed.

Mantle validators will ensure the following:

1. We have a proof or a `None` value for each operation.
    ```python
    assert len(op_proofs) == len(ops)
    ```

2. Each Operation is valid, and takes effect before the next one is validated. The transaction balance is accumulated over the same pass, so a `TRANSFER` consuming a note an earlier Operation created contributes that note's value like any other.
    ```python
    tx_balance = 0   # Signed 128-bit accumulator: the balance can be legitimately negative
    for op, op_proof in zip(ops, op_proofs):
        assert op.opcode in MANTLE_OPCODES
        validate_mantle_op(mantle_txhash(tx), op.opcode, op.payload, op_proof)
        if op.opcode == TRANSFER:
            for inp in op.inputs:
                tx_balance = checked_int128(tx_balance + get_value_from_note_id(inp))
            for out in op.outputs:
                tx_balance = checked_int128(tx_balance - out.value)
        execute_mantle_op(op.opcode, op.payload)

    def validate_mantle_op(txhash, opcode, payload, op_proof):
        if opcode == CHANNEL_INSCRIBE:
            validate_channel_inscribe(txhash, payload, op_proof)
        # elif opcode == ...
        #    ...

    def execute_mantle_op(opcode, payload):
        if opcode == CHANNEL_INSCRIBE:
            execute_channel_inscribe(payload)
        # elif opcode == ...
        #    ...
    ```

3. The Mantle Transaction excess balance pays at least the mandatory fees.
    ```python
    tx_mandatory_fee = mandatory_fees(signed_tx,                        # uint64
                                      permanent_storage_gas_price,
                                      execution_gas_base_price)
    assert tx_mandatory_fee <= tx_balance
    tx_priority_tip = checked_uint64(tx_balance - tx_mandatory_fee)
    ```

## Execution

*Given*

```python
SignedMantleTx(
    tx=MantleTx(ops),
    op_proofs
)
```

Mantle Validators execute each Operation in `ops` according to its opcode, in the order the Operations appear and along the state progression [Validation](#validation) defines. The subsections below define, for each opcode, what validating and executing an Operation amount to.

| *RESERVED* | *0x31 - 0xFF* |  |

## Channel Operations

Channels allow Zones to post their updates on chain. Channels form virtual chains that overlay on top of the Cryptarchia blockchain. Clients and Followers of a Zone can watch its channel to learn the state of that Zone. Each channel has an associated balance, enabling bridging between Zones and Bedrock.

### Message Ordering

Channels form virtual chains by having each message reference its parent message. The order of messages in these channels is enforced by the sequencer by building a hash chain of messages, i.e. new messages reference the previous messages through a parent hash. Given that Cryptarchia has long finality times, these message parent references allow Zone sequencers to continue to post new updates to channels without having to wait for finality. No matter how Cryptarchia forks and reorgs, the channel messages from honest sequencers will eventually be re-included in a way that satisfies the virtual chain order.

Configurations form a second hash chain within the channel: each configuration names the configuration it supersedes, so a pending reconfiguration stays valid while the sequencer keeps posting inscriptions.

The first time a message is sent to an unclaimed channel, the key that signs the initial message becomes the only accredited key in the list (Note that this key may correspond to a threshold signature key). Accredited keys of a channel forms a committee that can configure the channel, withdraw funds and take turns to write messages to that channel following a round-robin algorithm. Configuring a channel includes modifying the list of accredited keys, the round-robin parameters and the required number of signatures to withdraw funds or establish a new configuration.

Validators must maintain the following state to process channel Operations:

```python
channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState] # ChannelId is 32 bytes

class ChannelState:
    # Channel Configuration
    accredited_keys: list[Ed25519PublicKey]  # limited to 65 535 keys
    configuration_threshold: u16  # indicating how many keys are
                                  # required to update the configuration

    # Message Ordering
    tip_hash: hash         # Last message of the channel
    config_tip_hash: hash  # Last configuration of the channel

    # Decentralized Sequencing
    tip_slot: Slot
    tip_sequencer: u16      # indicating the actual
                            # sequencer position in the list of accredited keys
    tip_sequencer_starting_slot: Slot
    posting_timeframe: u32  # number of slots (0 = infinity)
    posting_timeout: u32    # number of slots (0 = no timeout)

    # Bridging
    transfer_threshold: u16  # indicating how many keys are
                             # required to transfer or withdraw funds from the channel

def default_channel(block_slot: Slot, keys: list[Ed25519PublicKey]) -> ChannelState:
    return ChannelState(
        tip_hash = ZERO,
        config_tip_hash = ZERO,
        tip_slot = block_slot,
        accredited_keys = keys,
        tip_sequencer = 0,
        tip_sequencer_starting_slot = block_slot,
        posting_timeframe = 0,
        posting_timeout = 0,
        configuration_threshold = 1,
        transfer_threshold = 1)
```

Note that the user chooses the ChannelId mapping to the ChannelState (but it’s restricted to 32 bytes). We don't currently impose restrictions on it, but we may do so in the future to prevent undesirable behaviors.

### Decentralized Sequencing

To determine which sequencer is currently authorized to send messages, we use a round-robin algorithm. When a message is posted to a channel, the following algorithm is used to determine who the sequencer is:

```python
# Round Robin algorithm determining the new sequencer index and the
# new sequencer starting slot
def round_robin(block_slot: Slot, channel: ChannelState) -> (u16, u64):
    elapsed_slots = block_slot - channel.tip_slot
    if elapsed_slots >= channel.posting_timeout and channel.posting_timeout != 0:
        # Get the number of sequencers that get timed out
        sequencers_timed_out = elapsed_slots // channel.posting_timeout
        index = (
            (channel.tip_sequencer + sequencers_timed_out)
            % len(channel.accredited_keys)
        )
        starting_slot = (
            channel.tip_slot
            + sequencers_timed_out * channel.posting_timeout
        )
    else:
        # Get the number of timeframes elapsed to get who is the sequencer
        tip_sequencer_duration = block_slot - channel.tip_sequencer_starting_slot
        index = (
            (channel.tip_sequencer + (tip_sequencer_duration // channel.posting_timeframe))
            % len(channel.accredited_keys)
        )
        starting_slot = (
            channel.tip_sequencer_starting_slot
            + (tip_sequencer_duration // channel.posting_timeframe) * channel.posting_timeframe
        )
    return (index, starting_slot)
```

### Bridging

Channels let their bridged funds keep participating in Proof of Stake. When a user deposits funds into a channel, the deposited notes stay on the ledger and are not turned into inert collateral. They are consumed and immediately re-created as channel notes that continue to count toward Proof of Stake and can still be used to create PoLs (see [Channel Notes](#channel-notes)). Two goals motivate this design:

- **More PoS participation, stronger security.** Funds deposited into a channel would otherwise leave the staking set. Keeping them as channel notes means the capital backing the application layer also backs consensus security, so bridging does not shrink the stake that secures the chain.
- **No split between security and application.** A user no longer has to choose between staking funds or using them in a channel. The same funds do both at once. They stay usable inside the channel while still earning Proof of Leadership rewards, so capital is never fragmented between the two.

**Ownership vs. staking power.** A `CHANNEL_DEPOSIT` separates the two rights that a normal note bundles together:

- *Ownership* moves to the channel. The note is registered in the ledger's `channel_notes` set with the channel as its owner, and the channel keeps full control over it. The deposited notes are consumed and re-created identically: they keep their value and `ZkPublicKey`, receive a new `NoteId` derived from the deposit's `OpId`, and are registered as channel-owned. The channel is now the party responsible for the note.
- *Staking power* stays with the `ZkPublicKey` carried by the note. That key does not confer ownership. It only delegates the note's value for PoL creation. Whoever controls the key is the one allowed to turn the note into a PoL and collect the resulting rewards. On deposit this key is still the depositor's, so the user keeps the PoS participation power they had before bridging.

Because the channel owns the note but does not hold the delegated key, the note earns rewards for the key holder, never for the channel itself.

**Ageing.** Because the deposit re-creates the notes under a new `NoteId`, a deposited note restarts the ageing process and must age again before it can create a PoL. Bridged funds still count toward Proof of Stake, so the goals above hold, but the participation is not continuous across the deposit.

**What each party can do.**

| Party | Can | Cannot |
|---|---|---|
| Holder of the note's `ZkPublicKey` (by default, the depositor) | Use the note to create a PoL and earn its leader rewards | Spend the note, withdraw it, reassign it, or use it as service stake |
| Channel sequencers (owner of the note) | Reassign the note to a different `ZkPublicKey` (`CHANNEL_TRANSFER`) and spend it to fund withdrawals (`CHANNEL_WITHDRAW`), both without `ZkSignature` verification | Use the note as service stake, or earn PoL rewards without first assigning the note to their own key |

This makes delegated staking explicit. Sequencers can assign a channel note to their own `ZkPublicKey` and earn the Proof of Leadership rewards it produces, but those rewards always follow the assigned key, so the channel earns nothing merely by owning the note. Conversely, ownership never leaving the channel is exactly what lets sequencers redelegate value or cover withdrawals at any time without a user signature.

**Warning: a deposit is a transfer of custody.** Depositors must understand that channel note handling is fully defined by the channel. Once a `CHANNEL_DEPOSIT` is executed the note belongs to the channel, and its sequencers can reassign it to any `ZkPublicKey` with `CHANNEL_TRANSFER` or release it to whoever they choose with `CHANNEL_WITHDRAW`, at any time and without any signature from the depositor. The ledger enforces no return path to the original depositor. Holding the note's `ZkPublicKey` grants PoS participation power only and never a claim on the value, so it confers no ability to recover the funds. A user who deposits into a dishonest or faulty channel has no on-chain recourse. Deposit only into channels you trust to honour their own withdrawal policy.

### CHANNEL_INSCRIBE

Write a message to a channel with the message data being permanently stored on the Logos Blockchain.

#### Payload

```python
class Inscribe:
    channel: ChannelId       # 32 bytes Channel being written to
    inscription : bytes      # Message to be written on the blockchain
    parent: hash             # Previous message in the channel
    signer: Ed25519PublicKey # Identity of message sender
```

#### Proof

```python
Ed25519Signature
```

#### Execution Gas

  Channel Inscribe Operations have a fixed Execution Gas cost of `EXECUTION_CHANNEL_INSCRIBE_GAS`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values.

#### Validation

  *Given*

```python
txhash: hash
msg: Inscribe
sig: Ed25519Signature

channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]
block_slot: Slot
```
 
  *Validate*

```python
if msg.channel in channels:
    chan = channels[msg.channel]
    current_sequencer_index = round_robin(block_slot, chan)[0]

    # Ensure the signer is the one authorized to write to the channel
    assert msg.signer == chan.accredited_keys[current_sequencer_index]

    # Ensure message is continuing the channel sequence
    assert msg.parent == chan.tip_hash
else:
    # Channel will be created automatically upon execution
    # Ensure that this message is the genesis message (parent == ZERO)
    assert msg.parent == ZERO

# Ensure the msg signer signature
assert Ed25519_verify(txhash, msg.signer, sig)
```

#### Execution

  *Given*

```python
msg: Inscribe
sig: Ed25519Signature

channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]
block_slot: Slot
```

  *Execute*

  1. If the channel does not exist, create it just-in-time.
      ```python
      if msg.channel not in channels:
          channels[msg.channel] = default_channel(block_slot, [msg.signer])
      ```

  2. Update the channel sequencer.
      ```python
      chan = channels[msg.channel]
      (new_sequencer_index, new_sequencer_starting_slot) = round_robin(block_slot, chan)

      chan.tip_sequencer_starting_slot = new_sequencer_starting_slot
      chan.tip_sequencer = new_sequencer_index
      ```

  3. Update the channel tip.
      ```python
      chan = channels[msg.channel]
      chan.tip_hash = hash(encode(msg))
      chan.tip_slot = block_slot
      ```

#### Example

```python
# Build the inscription
greeting = Inscription(
    channel=CHANNEL_EARTH,
    inscription=b"Live long and prosper",
    parent=ZERO
    signer=spock_pk
)

# Build the transfer operation to pay the fees
transfer = Transfer(inputs=[<spocks_note_id>], outputs=[<change_note>])

# Wrap it in a transaction
tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=CHANNEL_INSCRIBE, payload=encode(greeting)),
         Op(opcode=TRANSFER, payload=encode(transfer))],
)

# Sign the transaction
signed_tx = SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    op_proofs=[Ed25519_sign(mantle_txhash(tx), spock_sk),
               transfer.prove(spock_sk)]
)

# Send the transaction to the mempool
mempool.push(signed_tx)
```

### CHANNEL_CONFIG

Overwrite the configuration of a channel.

#### Payload

```python
class ChannelConfig:
    channel: ChannelId
    parent: hash             # Previous configuration of the channel
    keys: list[Ed25519PublicKey]
    posting_timeframe: u32
    posting_timeout: u32
    configuration_threshold: u16
    transfer_threshold: u16
```

#### Proof

A Channel Config is authorized by a threshold of the channel's accredited keys using [Multiple Ed25519 Signatures Verification](#multiple-ed25519-signatures-verification).

```python
class ChannelConfigOpProof:
    signatures: list[Ed25519Signature] # signatures from configuration_threshold
    indexes: list[u16]  # signatures of accredited keys with their index.
                        # indexes must be ordered from smallest to
                        # biggest without duplication
```

#### Execution Gas

  Channel Config Operations have a linear Execution Gas cost equal to `EXECUTION_CHANNEL_CONFIG_GAS * configuration_threshold`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values.

#### Validation

  *Given*

```python
txhash: zkhash
config: ChannelConfig
proof: ChannelConfigOpProof
channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]
```

  *Validate*

```python
assert config.configuration_threshold > 0
assert config.transfer_threshold > 0
assert len(config.keys) > 0
assert len(config.keys) < 2^16
# The configuration threshold must be reachable with the accredited keys,
# otherwise the channel would be locked out of any future reconfiguration
assert config.configuration_threshold <= len(config.keys)

if config.channel in channels:
    chan = channels[config.channel]

    # Ensure the configuration is extending the last configuration
    # of the channel
    assert config.parent == chan.config_tip_hash

    # Verify the configuration_threshold signatures (see Appendix)
    MultiEd25519_verify(txhash,
                        proof.signatures,
                        proof.indexes,
                        chan.accredited_keys,
                        chan.configuration_threshold)
else:
    # Channel will be created automatically upon execution
    # Ensure that this configuration is the genesis configuration
    assert config.parent == ZERO
```

#### Execution

  *Given*

```python
config: ChannelConfig

channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]
block_slot: Slot
```

  *Execute*

  1. If the channel does not exist, create it just-in-time.

      ```python
      if config.channel not in channels:
          channels[config.channel] = default_channel(block_slot, config.keys)
      ```

  2. Update the configuration.

      ```python
      chan = channels[config.channel]

      # Update Channel Configuration Parameters
      chan.accredited_keys = config.keys
      chan.configuration_threshold = config.configuration_threshold

      # Update Decentralized Sequencing Parameters
      chan.tip_slot = block_slot
      chan.tip_sequencer = 0
      chan.tip_sequencer_starting_slot = block_slot
      chan.posting_timeframe = config.posting_timeframe
      chan.posting_timeout = config.posting_timeout

      # Update Bridging Parameters
      chan.transfer_threshold = config.transfer_threshold
      ```

  3. Update the configuration tip.

      ```python
      chan = channels[config.channel]
      chan.config_tip_hash = hash(encode(config))
      ```

#### Example

  Suppose the unique sequencer of Zone A wants to add a key to the list of accredited keys:

```python
# Given a key to add and the current configuration tip of the channel
new_sequencer_pk: Ed25519PublicKey
zone_a_config_tip: hash

# The unique sequencer encodes the update and builds the payload
config = ChannelConfig(
    channel=ZONE_A,
    parent=zone_a_config_tip,
    keys=[old_sequencer_pk, new_sequencer_pk],
    posting_timeframe = 5000,
    posting_timeout = 500,
    configuration_threshold = 2,
    transfer_threshold = 1
)

# Build the transfer operation to pay the fees
transfer = Transfer(inputs=[old_sequencer_funds], outputs=[<change_note>])

tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=CHANNEL_CONFIG, payload=encode(config)),
         Op(opcode=TRANSFER, payload=encode(transfer))],
)

signed_tx = SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    op_proofs=[[Ed25519_sign(mantle_txhash(tx), old_sequencer_sk)], [0]],
               transfer.prove(old_sequencer_sk)]
)
```

### CHANNEL_DEPOSIT

Deposit notes to a channel. The inputs are consumed and re-created as channel notes under a new `NoteId`, which resets their ageing and prevents the deposit from being replayed after a withdrawal.

#### Payload

```python
class ChannelDeposit:
    channel: ChannelId
    inputs: list[NoteId]  # the notes to be consumed and re-created as channel notes
    metadata: bytes
```

#### Proof

  A Channel Deposit proves the ownership of the notes being consumed using a [Zero Knowledge Signature Scheme (ZkSignature)](#zero-knowledge-signature-scheme-zksignature).

```python
ZkSignature
```

#### Execution Gas

  Channel Deposit Operations have a fixed Execution Gas cost of `EXECUTION_CHANNEL_DEPOSIT_GAS`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values.

#### Validation

  *Given*

```python
mantle_txhash: zkhash # zkhash of mantle tx containing this ledger tx
deposit: ChannelDeposit
deposit_proof: ZkSignature

channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]

ledger: Ledger
```

  *Validate*

  1. Verify that the channel exist
      ```python
      assert deposit.channel in channels
      ```

  2. Ensure all inputs are spendable and not already channel notes.
      ```python
      ledger.assert_spendable(deposit.inputs)
      ```

  3. Validate ownership over deposited notes.
      ```python
      input_notes = [ledger[input_note_id] for input_note_id in deposit.inputs]
      input_pks = [note.public_key for note in input_notes]
      assert ZkSignature_verify(mantle_txhash, deposit_proof, input_pks)
      ```

#### Execution

  *Given*

```python
deposit: ChannelDeposit

channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]

ledger: Ledger
```

  *Execute*

Consume the inputs and create the same Note with new NoteId as channel notes owned by the channel.

```python
# read the notes that are being moved into the channel
notes_to_add = [ledger[input_note_id] for input_note_id in deposit.inputs]

# consume the inputs, which are regular notes and not registered in channel_notes
ledger.execute_spending(deposit.inputs)

# re-create them as channel notes under a new NoteId
deposit_id = derive_op_id(deposit)
ledger.execute_adding(deposit_id, notes_to_add, deposit.channel)
```

#### Example

  Suppose Alice wants to make a deposit of 50 tokens on Zone A.

```python
# Alice encodes her deposit
deposit = ChannelDeposit(
    channel=ZONE_A,
    inputs=[alice_deposit_note_id]    # This is a note of 50 tokens
    metadata=b"deposit to address: 0x..."
)

# Build the transfer operation to pay the fees
transfer = Transfer(inputs=[Alice_funds], outputs=[<change_note>])


tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=CHANNEL_DEPOSIT, payload=encode(deposit)),
         Op(opcode=TRANSFER, payload=encode(transfer))],
)

signed_tx = SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    op_proofs=[deposit.prove(Alice_sk), transfer.prove(Alice_sk)],
)
```

A Zone that credits a deposit in its own state must be sure the deposit really lands on-chain. If the Zone reflects the deposit through a `CHANNEL_INSCRIBE` posted in a separate Mantle Transaction, a reorganization can reorder the two so that the inscription is included while the deposit is not, leaving the Zone crediting funds it never received. Two options avoid this:

- Wait for the deposit to be finalized before interpreting it, at the cost of the finalization delay.
- Make the inscription conditional on the deposit, by including a `CHANNEL_TRANSFER` that consumes the deposited note in the same Mantle Transaction as the inscription. Mantle Transactions execute atomically, so the inscription is included only if the deposited note exists and is consumed. This removes the waiting period entirely.

The second option resets the ageing of the value. A `CHANNEL_TRANSFER` consumes its inputs and creates new notes, so the resulting note starts the ageing process again and must age before it can create a PoL. A `CHANNEL_DEPOSIT` resets ageing for the same reason, since it consumes its inputs and re-creates them under a new `NoteId`. A `CHANNEL_WITHDRAW` keeps the `NoteId` of the notes it releases and therefore never resets ageing.

### CHANNEL_WITHDRAW

Withdraw notes from a channel.

#### Payload

```python
class ChannelWithdraw:
    channel: ChannelId
    inputs: list[NoteId]
```

#### Proof

A Channel Withdraw is authorized by a threshold of the channel's accredited keys using [Multiple Ed25519 Signatures Verification](#multiple-ed25519-signatures-verification).

```python
class ChannelWithdrawOpProof:
    signatures: list[Ed25519Signature] # exactly transfer_threshold signatures
    indexes: list[int]    # signatures of accredited keys with their index
                          # indexes must be ordered from smallest to
                          # biggest without duplication
```

#### Execution Gas

  Channel Withdraw Operations have a linear Execution Gas cost equal to `EXECUTION_CHANNEL_WITHDRAW_GAS * transfer_threshold`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values.

#### Validation

  *Given*

```python
txhash: zkhash
withdrawal: ChannelWithdraw
proof: ChannelWithdrawOpProof

channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]
ledger: Ledger
```

  *Validate*

  1. Check that the channel exists
      ```python
      assert withdrawal.channel in channels
      ```

  2. Check that the inputs are valid and belongs to the channel
      ```python
      ledger.assert_spendable(withdrawal.inputs, withdrawal.channel)
      ```

  3. Check the signatures (see [Multiple Ed25519 Signatures Verification](#multiple-ed25519-signatures-verification))
      ```python
      MultiEd25519_verify(txhash,
                          proof.signatures,
                          proof.indexes,
                          channels[withdrawal.channel].accredited_keys,
                          channels[withdrawal.channel].transfer_treshold)
      ```

#### Execution

  *Given*

```python
withdrawal: ChannelWithdraw

channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]
ledger: Ledger
```

  *Execute*

Remove the inputs from channel notes owned by the channel. The notes are neither consumed nor re-created: they keep their NoteId, value and ZkPublicKey, and are simply unregistered in the channel_notes set.
```python
for note_id in withdrawal.inputs:
    ledger.channel_notes.pop(note_id)
```
#### Example

  Suppose the unique sequencer of Zone A wants to withdraw 50 tokens.

```python
# Sequencer encodes his withdrawal
withdrawal = ChannelWithdraw(
    channel=ZONE_A,
    inputs  = [Channel_note_id]
)

# Build the transfer operation to pay the fees
transfer = Transfer(inputs=[Sequencer_funds], outputs=[<change_note>])

tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=CHANNEL_WITHDRAW, payload=encode(withdrawal)),
         Op(opcode=TRANSFER, payload=encode(transfer))],
)

signed_tx = SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    op_proofs=[[[Ed25519_sign(mantle_txhash(tx), sequencer_sk)],[0]],
               transfer.prove(Sequencer_node_sk)],
)
```

### CHANNEL_TRANSFER

Assign funds from a channel to new `ZkPublicKey`. This funds are only usable to participate in PoS and to withdraw from the channel.

#### Payload

```python
class ChannelTransfer:
    channel: ChannelId
    inputs: list[NoteId]
    outputs: list[Note]
```

#### Proof

```python
class ChannelTransferOpProof:
    signatures: list[Ed25519Signature] # signature from transfer_threshold keys
    indexes: list[int]    # signatures of accredited keys with their index.
                          # indexes must be ordered from smallest to biggest without duplication
```

#### Execution Gas

`CHANNEL_TRANSFER` Operations have a linear Execution Gas cost equal to `EXECUTION_CHANNEL_TRANSFER_GAS * transfer_threshold`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values.

#### Validation

*Given*

```python
txhash: zkhash
chan_transfer: ChannelTransfer
proof: ChannelTransferOpProof

channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]
ledger: Ledger
```

*Validate*

1. Check that the outputs are valid

```python
ledger.assert_valid_output(chan_transfer.outputs)
```

2. Check that the channel exists

```python
assert chan_transfer.channel in channels
```

3. Check that the inputs are valid and belongs to the channel

```python
ledger.assert_spendable(chan_transfer.inputs, chan_transfer.channel)
```

4. Check the balance

```python
input_amount = checked_uint64(sum(ledger.get_note(input).value for input in chan_transfer.inputs))
output_amount = checked_uint64(sum(output.value for output in chan_transfer.outputs))
assert input_amount == output_amount
```

5. Check the signatures (see [Multiple Ed25519 Signatures Verification](#multiple-ed25519-signatures-verification))
```python
MultiEd25519_verify(txhash,
					proof.signatures,
                    proof.indexes,
                    channels[chan_transfer.channel].accredited_keys,
                    channels[chan_transfer.channel].transfer_treshold)
```

#### Execution

*Given*

```python
chan_transfer: ChannelTransfer

channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]
ledger: Ledger
```

*Execute*

1. Remove inputs from the ledger

```python
ledger.execute_spending(chan_transfer.inputs, chan_transfer.channel)
```

2. Add outputs to the ledger.

```python
chan_transfer_id = derive_op_id(chan_transfer)
ledger.execute_adding(chan_transfer_id, chan_transfer.outputs, chan_transfer.channel)
```

#### Example

Suppose the unique sequencer of Zone A wants to attribute 50 tokens to themself.

```python
# Sequencer encodes their assignation
chan_transfer = ChannelTransfer(
    channel=ZONE_A,
    inputs = [Channel_note_id]
    outputs = [Note(pk=alice, value=50)]
)

# Build the transfer operation to pay the fees
transfer = Transfer(inputs=[Sequencer_funds], outputs=[<change_note>])

tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=CHANNEL_TRANSFER, payload=encode(chan_transfer)),
         Op(opcode=TRANSFER, payload=encode(transfer))],
)

signed_tx = SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    op_proofs=[[[Ed25519_sign(mantle_txhash(tx), sequencer_sk)],[0]],
                              transfer.prove(Sequencer_node_sk)],
)
```

## Service Declaration Protocol (SDP) Operations

These Operations implement the [Service Declaration Protocol](bedrock-service-declaration-protocol.md).

Validators must keep the following state when implementing SDP Operations:

```python
service_notes: dict[NoteId, ZkPublicKey]
providers: dict[Ed25519PublicKey, ZkPublicKey]
declarations: dict[ZkPublicKey, DeclarationInfo]
```

`service_notes` and `providers` index the declarations by the two identifiers
that are not their key, so each uniqueness rule is one lookup.

### Common SDP Structures

```python
class ServiceType(Enum):
    BN=0 # Blend Network; the one-byte discriminant is the canonical encoding

class Locator(bytes):
    # multiaddr binary form; the canonical encoding
    # (see SDP: Locators)
    def validate(self):
        assert len(self) <= 329
        assert validate_multiaddr(self)

class MinStake:
    stake_threshold: int # stake value
    epoch: EpochNumber # epoch number

class ServiceParameters:
    inactivity_period: NumberOfEpochs # number of epochs
    epoch: EpochNumber                # epoch number at which the Service Parameters were set

class DeclarationInfo:
    service: ServiceType
    locators: list[Locator]
    provider_id: Ed25519PublicKey
    service_note_id: NoteId
    active: EpochNumber
    withdraw_at: EpochNumber | None
    # SDP ops updating a declaration must use monotonically increasing nonces
    nonce: int
```

### SDP_DECLARE

The service registration follows the definition given in [**Declaration Message**](bedrock-service-declaration-protocol.md#declaration-message):

#### Payload

```python
class DeclarationMessage:
    service_type: ServiceType
    locators: list[Locator]
    provider_id: Ed25519PublicKey
    zk_id: ZkPublicKey
    service_note_id: NoteId
```

Service notes are introduced in [Service notes](#service-notes) and serve as Service collaterals. They cannot be spent before the owner withdraws its participation from the declared service.

#### Proof

```python
class DeclarationProof:
    zk_sig: ZkSignature             # signature proving ownership over
                                    # service note and zk_id
    provider_sig: Ed25519Signature  # signature proving ownership of provider key
```

  see: [Zero Knowledge Signature Scheme (ZkSignature)](#zero-knowledge-signature-scheme-zksignature).

#### Execution Gas

  SDP Declare Operations have a fixed Execution Gas cost of `EXECUTION_SDP_DECLARE_GAS`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values.

#### Validation

  *Given*

```python
txhash: zkhash                  # the txhash of the transaction we are validating
declaration: DeclarationMessage # the declaration we are validating
proof: DeclarationProof

min_stake: MinStake      # the (global) minimum stake setting
ledger: Ledger           # the set of unspent notes
service_notes: dict[NoteId, ZkPublicKey]
providers: dict[Ed25519PublicKey, ZkPublicKey]
declarations: dict[ZkPublicKey, DeclarationInfo]
```

  *Validate*

  The declaration is verified according to [Declare](bedrock-service-declaration-protocol.md#declare).

  1. Ensure ownership over the service note, `zk_id` and `provider_id`.
      ```python
      assert ZkSignature_verify(
          txhash, proof.zk_sig, [note.public_key, declaration.zk_id]
      )
      assert Ed25519_verify(txhash, proof.provider_sig, provider_id)
      ```

  2. Ensure no identifier is already taken
     ([Identifier Uniqueness](bedrock-service-declaration-protocol.md#identifier-uniqueness)).
      ```python
      assert declaration.zk_id not in declarations
      assert declaration.service_note_id not in service_notes
      assert declaration.provider_id not in providers
      ```

  3. Ensure the locators list is non-empty and has no more than 8 entries.
      ```python
      assert len(declaration.locators) >= 1
      assert len(declaration.locators) <= 8
      ```

  4. Ensure the service note exists and its value is sufficient for joining the service.
      ```python
      assert ledger.is_unspent(declaration.service_note_id)
      note = ledger.get_note(declaration.service_note_id)
      assert note.value >= min_stake.stake_threshold
      ```

#### Execution

  *Given*

```python
declaration: DeclarationMessage # the declaration we are executing
current_epoch: EpochNumber
service_notes: dict[NoteId, ZkPublicKey]
providers: dict[Ed25519PublicKey, ZkPublicKey]
```

  *Execute*

  1. Index the note and the provider identity by this declaration.
      ```python
      service_notes[declaration.service_note_id] = declaration.zk_id
      providers[declaration.provider_id] = declaration.zk_id
      ```

  2. Store the declaration as explained in [**Declaration Storage**](bedrock-service-declaration-protocol.md#declaration-storage).
      ```python
      declarations[declaration.zk_id] = DeclarationInfo(
          service=declaration.service_type,
          locators=declaration.locators,
          provider_id=declaration.provider_id,
          service_note_id=declaration.service_note_id,
          active=current_epoch + 2,
          withdraw_at=None,
          nonce=0,
      )
      ```

#### Example

```python
# Assume `alice_note` is in the ledger:
alice_note = Utxo(
    txhash=0x2948904F2F0F479B8F8197694B30184B0D2ED1C1CD2A1EC0FB85D299A192A447,
    output_number=3,
    note=Note(value=500, public_key=alice_pk_1),
)

# Alice wishes to lock it to join the Blend network
declaration=DeclarationMessage(
    service_type=ServiceType.BN,
    locators=["/ip4/203.0.113.10/tcp/4001/p2p"],
    provider_id=alice_provider_pk,
    zk_id=alice_pk_2,
    service_note_id=alice_note.id()
)

# Build the transfer operation to pay the fees
transfer = Transfer(inputs=[fee_note_id], outputs=[])


tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=SDP_DECLARE, payload=encode(declaration)),
         Op(opcode=TRANSFER, payload=encode(transfer))],
)
txhash = mantle_txhash(tx)

declaration_proof = DeclarationProof(
    # proof of ownership of the staked note and zk_id
    zk_sig=ZkSignature([alice_sk_1, alice_sk_2], txhash),
    # proof of ownership of the provider id
    provider_sig=Ed25519Signature(alice_provider_sk, txhash),
)

SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    op_proofs=[declaration_proof, transfer.prove(alice_sk_1)],
)
```

### SDP_WITHDRAW

The service withdrawal follows the definition given in [Withdraw Message](bedrock-service-declaration-protocol.md#withdraw-message).

#### Payload

```python
class WithdrawMessage:
    zk_id: ZkPublicKey
    nonce: int
```

#### Proof

  A signature from the `zk_id` and the service note `pk` attached to the declaration is required for withdrawing from a service, (see [Zero Knowledge Signature Scheme (ZkSignature)](#zero-knowledge-signature-scheme-zksignature)).

```python
ZkSignature
```

#### Execution Gas

  SDP Withdraw Operations have a fixed Execution Gas cost of `EXECUTION_SDP_WITHDRAW_GAS`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values.

#### Validation

  *Given*

```python
txhash: zkhash # Mantle transaction hash of the tx containing this operation
withdraw: WithdrawMessage
signature: ZkSignature

ledger: Ledger
service_notes: dict[NoteId, ZkPublicKey]
declarations: dict[ZkPublicKey, DeclarationInfo]
```

  *Validate*

  1. Ensure the declaration exists, and take the note it locked.
      ```python
      assert withdraw.zk_id in declarations
      declare_info = declarations[withdraw.zk_id]
      service_note_id = declare_info.service_note_id
      ```

  2. Validate SDP withdrawal according to [**Withdraw**](bedrock-service-declaration-protocol.md#withdraw).
      1. Ensure that note is still present and locked to this declaration.
          ```python
          assert ledger.is_unspent(service_note_id)
          assert service_notes[service_note_id] == withdraw.zk_id
          ```
      2. Ensure the declaration is not already scheduled for withdrawal.
          ```python
          assert declare_info.withdraw_at is None
          ```
      3. Ensure service note `pk` and the `zk_id` of this declaration authorized this Operation.
          ```python
          service_note = ledger[service_note_id]
          assert ZkSignature_verify(txhash, signature, [service_note.pk, withdraw.zk_id])
          ```
      4. Ensure that the nonce is greater than the previous one.
          ```python
          assert withdraw.nonce > declare_info.nonce
          ```

#### Execution

  *Given*

```python
withdraw: WithdrawMessage
signature: ZkSignature

current_epoch: EpochNumber # current epoch
ledger: Ledger
service_notes: dict[NoteId, ZkPublicKey]
declarations: dict[ZkPublicKey, DeclarationInfo]
```

  *Execute*

  Executes the withdrawal protocol [**Withdraw**](bedrock-service-declaration-protocol.md#withdraw).

  Withdrawal only records the intent: `withdraw_at` is set to the current
  (withdrawal) epoch `e`, the node's last rewardable epoch. The declaration is
  removed and its note unlocked at epoch `e+2` by the
  [SDP Epoch Finalization](#sdp-epoch-finalization) step, right after the final
  reward is paid out.

  1. Update the declaration info with the nonce and the withdrawal epoch.
      ```python
      declare_info = declarations[withdraw.zk_id]
      declare_info.nonce = withdraw.nonce
      declare_info.withdraw_at = current_epoch
      ```

#### Example

```python
withdraw=Withdraw(
    zk_id=alice_pk_2,
    nonce=1579532
)

# Build the transfer operation to pay the fees
transfer = Transfer(inputs=[alices_service_note_id],
                    outputs=[Note(100, alice_note_pk)])

tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=SDP_WITHDRAW, payload=encode(withdraw)),
         Op(opcode=TRANSFER, payload=encode(transfer))],
)

SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    # proof ownership of the withdrawn note and zk id
    op_proofs=[ZkSignature_sign([alice_note_sk, alice_sk], mantle_txhash(tx)),
               transfer.prove(alice_sk)]
)
```

### SDP Epoch Finalization

Withdrawn declarations are removed by Mantle as part of the epoch transition,
not when the `WithdrawMessage` is processed. A node that withdrew in epoch `e`
has `withdraw_at == e`, and its last rewardable epoch is `e`; the epoch-`e`
rewards are distributed in the first block of epoch `e+2` (see
[Service Reward Distribution Protocol](bedrock-service-reward-distribution.md)).
In that same first block, **after** the rewards have been distributed, every
declaration whose final reward has been paid out (`withdraw_at <= current_epoch - 2`)
is removed and its note unlocked.

  *Given*

```python
current_epoch: EpochNumber
service_notes: dict[NoteId, ZkPublicKey]
providers: dict[Ed25519PublicKey, ZkPublicKey]
declarations: dict[ZkPublicKey, DeclarationInfo]
```

  *Execute*

  For every `zk_id`, `declare_info` in `declarations` where
  `declare_info.withdraw_at is not None and declare_info.withdraw_at <= current_epoch - 2`:

  1. Release the note and the provider identity the declaration held.
      ```python
      del service_notes[declare_info.service_note_id]
      del providers[declare_info.provider_id]
      ```

  2. Remove the declaration.
      ```python
      del declarations[zk_id]
      ```

### SDP_ACTIVE

The service active action follows the definition given in [Active Message](bedrock-service-declaration-protocol.md#active-message).

#### Payload

```python
class Active:
    zk_id: ZkPublicKey
    nonce: int
    metadata: bytes # a service-specific node activeness metadata
```

#### Proof

```python
ZkSignature
```

#### Execution Gas

  SDP Active Operations have a fixed Execution Gas cost of `EXECUTION_SDP_ACTIVE_GAS`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values.

#### Validation

  *Given*

```python
txhash: zkhash # Mantle transaction hash of the tx containing this operation
active: Active
signature: ZkSignature

declarations: dict[ZkPublicKey, DeclarationInfo]
```

  *Validate*

```python
assert active.zk_id in declarations
declaration_info = declarations[active.zk_id]

assert active.nonce > declaration_info.nonce

assert ZkSignature_verify(txhash, signature, active.zk_id)
```

#### Execution

  Executes the active protocol [Active](bedrock-service-declaration-protocol.md#active). The activation, i.e. setting the `active` of the `DeclarationInfo`, is handled by the service-specific logic.

#### Example

```python
active=Active(
    zk_id=alice_pk_2,
    nonce=1579532,
    metadata=b"Look, I am still doing my job"
)

# Build the transfer operation to pay the fees
transfer = Transfer(inputs=[fee_note_id], outputs=[])

tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=SDP_ACTIVE, payload=encode(active))],
)
txhash = mantle_txhash(tx)

SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    op_proofs=[Ed25519_sign(txhash, validator_sk), transfer.prove(fee_note_sk)]
)
```

## Leader Operations

### LEADER_CLAIM

This Operation claims the leader's block reward anonymously.

#### Payload

```python
class ClaimRequest:
    rewards_root: zkhash # Merkle root used in the proof for voucher membership
    voucher_nf: zkhash
    public_key: ZkPublicKey
```

#### Proof

  The provider proves that they have won a proof of Leadership before the start of the current epoch, i.e., their reward voucher is indeed in the voucher set: [Proof of Claim](#proof-of-claim).

#### Execution gas

  Leader Claim Operations have a fixed Execution Gas cost of `EXECUTION_LEADER_CLAIM_GAS`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values.

#### Validation

  *Given*

```python
mantle_txhash: zkhash
claim : ClaimRequest
last_voucher_root: zkhash # The last root of the voucher Merkle tree
                          # at the start of the epoch
voucher_nullifier_set: set[zkhash]
proof: ProofOfClaim
```

  *Validate*

```python
assert claim.voucher_nf not in voucher_nullifier_set
assert claim.rewards_root == last_voucher_root
validate_proof(claim, proof, mantle_txhash)
```

#### Execution

  *Given*

```python
claim: ClaimRequest

ledger: Ledger
voucher_nullifier_set: set[zkhash]
leaders_rewards: TokenValue   # The pool of tokens to be claim by leaders
leader_reward: TokenValue     # The amount one leader can claim
```

  *Execution*

  1. Add `claim.voucher_nf` to the `voucher_nullifier_set`.
  2. Denoting by `leader_reward` the amount defined for leader rewards in [Leaders Reward](bedrock-anonymous-leaders-reward.md#leaders-reward), construct a single output note with value leader_reward under the public key defined in the payload, and insert it into the Ledger:
      ```python
      output_note=Note(
          value = leader_reward
          public_key = claim.public_key,
      )
      claim_id = derive_op_id(claim)
      ledger.execute_adding(claim_id, [output_note])
      ```

  3. Reduce the leader’s reward `leaders_rewards` value by the same amount (without ZK proof).

#### Example

```python
secret_voucher = 0xDEADBEAF;
reward_voucher = leader_claim_voucher(secret_voucher)
voucher_nullifier = leader_claim_nullifier(secret_voucher)

claim=ClaimRequest(
    rewards_root=REWARDS_MERKLE_TREE.root(),
    voucher_nf=voucher_nullifier,
    public_key=leader_one_time_key
)

# Build the transfer operation to pay the fees
transfer = Transfer(inputs=[<fee_note>], outputs=[<change_note>])

tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=LEADER_CLAIM, payload=encode(claim)),
         Op(opcode=TRANSFER, payload=encode(transfer))],
)

claim_proof = claim.prove(
    secret_voucher,
    REWARDS_MERKLE_TREE.path(leaf=reward_voucher),
    mantle_txhash(tx)
)

SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    op_proofs=[claim_proof, transfer.prove(fee_note_sk)]
)
```

## TRANSFER

Transactions must prove the ownership of spent notes. In classical blockchains, this is done through a signature. To stay compatible with our architecture, the signature is done by a ZK proof (see [Zero Knowledge Signature Scheme (ZkSignature)](#zero-knowledge-signature-scheme-zksignature)), proving the knowledge of the secret key associated with the public key.

Transactions allow complete transaction linkability and the public key spending the note is not hidden.

### Payload

```python
class Transfer:
    inputs: list[NoteId]  # the list of consumed note identifiers
                          # must be non-empty
    outputs: list[Note]
```

### Proof

  A Transfer proves the ownership of the consumed notes using a [Zero Knowledge Signature Scheme (ZkSignature)](#zero-knowledge-signature-scheme-zksignature).

```python
ZkSignature
```

### Execution Gas

  Transfer have a fixed Execution Gas cost of `EXECUTION_TRANSFER_GAS`. See [Gas Determination](#gas-determination) for the Execution Gas values.

### Validation

  *Given*

```python
mantle_txhash: zkhash # zkhash of mantle tx containing this ledger tx
transfer: Transfer
transfer_proof: ZkSignature

ledger: Ledger
```

  *Validate*

  1. Ensure all inputs are spendable and not in a channel.
      ```python
      ledger.assert_spendable(transfer.inputs)
      ```

  2. Validate transfer proof to show ownership over input notes.
      ```python
      input_notes = [ledger[input_note_id] for input_note_id in transfer.inputs]
      input_pks = [note.public_key for note in input_notes]
      assert ZkSignature_verify(mantle_txhash, transfer_proof, input_pks)
      ```

  3. Ensure outputs are valid.
      ```python
      ledger.assert_valid_output(transfer.output)
      ```

### Execution

  *Given*

```python
transfer: Transfer
transfer_proof: ZkSignature

ledger: Ledger
```

  *Execution*

  1. Remove inputs from the ledger.
      ```python
      ledger.execute_spending(transfer.inputs)
      ```

  2. Add outputs to the ledger.
      ```python
      transfer_id = derive_operation_id(transfer)
      ledger.execute_adding(transfer_id, transfer.outputs)
      ```

### Example

```python
alice_note_id = ... # assume Alice holds a note worth 501 tokens
bob_note=Note(
    value=500
    public_key=bob_pk,
)

transfer = Transfer(
    inputs=[alice_note_id],
    outputs=[bob_note],
)
```

# Mantle Ledger

## Notes

Notes are composed of two fields representing their value and their owner:

```python
class Note:
    value: TokenValue   # uint64
    public_key: ZkPublicKey # 32 bytes
```

### Note Id

A note can be uniquely identified by the Operation that created it and its output number: `(op_id, output_number)` if each Operation are uniquely identifiable. For this reason, every Operation that output notes have a unique payload that is used to derive the Operation identifier. Because it is often useful to have a commitment to the note fields for use in ZK proofs (e.g., for PoL), we included the note in the note identifier derivation.

```python
def derive_op_id(operation: Op) -> Hash:
    op_bytes = encode(op)
    h = Hasher() # /!\ This is a classic hash not a zkhash /!\
    h.update(b"OPERATION_ID_V1")
    h.update(op_bytes)
    return h.digest()

def derive_note_id(op_id: Hash, output_number: int, note: Note) -> NoteId:
    return zkhash(
        FiniteField(b"NOTE_ID_V1", byte_order="little", modulus= p),
        FiniteField(op_id, byte_order="little", modulus= p),
        FiniteField(output_number, byte_order="little", modulus= p),
        FiniteField(note.value, byte_order="little", modulus= p),
        note.public_key
    )
```

`op_id` is a classical 256-bit hash digest and must be reduced to a field element before being passed to the ZkHasher. We apply a direct modular reduction mod `p` (via `FiniteField(..., modulus=p)`). Since $`p \approx2^{-254}`$, the reduction is slightly non-uniform, values in $`[0, 2^{256} \mod p)`$ appear one extra time, but this is inconsequential in practice: the collision probability remains around $`2^{-254}`$, and `NoteId` uniqueness is not derived from uniformity of `op_id` over $`𝔽_p`$ but from the collision-resistance of the underlying hash and per-operation payload uniqueness.

These note identifiers uniquely define notes in the system and cannot be chosen by the user. Nodes maintain the set of notes through a dictionary mapping the NoteId to the note.

### Service notes

Service notes are special notes in Mantle that serve as collateral for Service Declarations. A note can become a service note after being locked by executing a Declare Operation, preventing it from being spent until explicitly released through a Withdraw Operation. A note backs at most one declaration, so the system maintains a mapping of each service note ID to the declaration it supports. Though locked, these notes remain in the Ledger and can still participate in Proof of Stake. When a service provider withdraws its declaration, the note it locked becomes unlocked and available for spending again.

### Channel Notes

Channel notes are on-ledger notes minted to represent channel funds. They are distinct from Service Notes as they can’t be used to declare a service. However, they follow the same ageing rule as ordinary notes since they are part of the ledger and can be used for PoL creation once aged enough.

The system maintains a `channel_notes` set in the Ledger tracking all active channel `NoteId` and their respective `ChannelId`.

## Ledger

```python
class Ledger:
    notes: list[Note]
    service_notes: dict[NoteId, ZkPublicKey]
    channel_notes: dict[NoteId, ChannelId]
```

### Input Notes Spendability Validation

A note is spendable if and only if it exists, it is not spent or a service note. The following function validates that an input of notes can be consumed:

```python
class Ledger:
    def assert_spendable(inputs: list[NoteId], channel_id: ChannelId | None):
		# Assert inputs are empty
		assert len(inputs) > 0

        ## Check there is no duplicate
        assert len(inputs) == len(set(inputs))

            # Check that each note is individualy not a service note, for the correct channel and unspent
            for note_id in inputs:
                assert ledger.is_unspent(note_id)
                assert note_id not in service_notes
                if channel_id is None:
                	assert note_id not in ledger.channel_notes
                else:
                	assert note_id in ledger.channel_notes
                    assert ledger.channel_notes[note_id] == channel_id
```

### Output Notes Validation

Before an output of notes can be inserted into the Ledger, every note field must satisfy the following constraints:

```python
class Ledger:
    def assert_valid_output(outputs: list[Note]):
        for note in outputs:
            assert note.value > 0
            assert note.value <= 2**64-1
```

### Consuming Input Notes Execution

Consuming a set of notes removes them from the Ledger’s Merkle tree and recycles their leaf indices:

```python
class Ledger:
    def execute_spending(inputs: list[NoteId], channel_id: ChannelId | None):
        for note_id in inputs:
            # updates the merkle tree to zero out the leaf for this entry
            # and adds that leaf index to the list of unused leaves
            ledger.remove(note_id)
            if channel_id is not None:
                ledger.channel_notes.pop(note_id)
```

### Creating Output Notes Execution

Creating notes derives their `NoteId` from the Operation’s `OpId` and insert them in the Ledger:

```python
class Ledger:
    def execute_adding(op_id: Hash, outputs: list[Note], channel_id: ChannelId | None):
        for (output_index, output_note) in enumerate(outputs):
            output_note_id = derive_note_id(op_id, output_index, output_note)
            ledger.add(output_note_id)
            if channel_id is not None:
                ledger.channel_notes[output_note_id] = channel_id
```

## Zero Knowledge Signature Scheme (ZkSignature)

A proof attesting that for the following public values:

```python
class ZkSignaturePublic:
    public_keys: list[ZkPublicKey] # public keys signing the message (len = 32)
    msg: zkhash # a finite field element uniquely representing the message
```

The prover knows a witness:

```python
class ZkSignatureWitness:
    # The list of secret keys used to signed the message
    secret_keys: list[ZkSecretKey] # (len = 32)
```

Such that the following constraints hold:

- The number of secret keys is equal to the number of public keys.
  ```python
  assert len(secret_keys) == len(public_keys)
  ```

- Each public key is derived from the corresponding secret key.
  ```python
  assert all(
      notes[i].public_key == zkhash(FiniteField(b"KDF", byte_order="little", modulus= p), secret_keys[i])
      for i in range(len(public_keys))
  )
  ```

- The proof is bound to `msg` (it’s the `mantle_tx_hash` reduced modulo $`p`$ in case of transactions).

  For implementation, the ZkSignature circuit will take a maximum of 32 public keys as inputs. To prove ownership of fewer keys, the remaining inputs will be padded with the public key corresponding to the secret key `0` and ignored during execution. The outputs have no size limit since they are included in the hashed message.

## Multiple Ed25519 Signatures Verification

Several operations (e.g. [Channel Configuration](#channel-configuration) and
[Channel Withdraw](#channel-withdraw)) authorize an action with a threshold of
Ed25519 signatures produced by a list of accredited keys. Each signature comes
with the index, in the accredited keys list, of the key that produced it. The
verification is factored out in the following routine:

*Given*

```python
msg: zkhash                        # the message being signed (the mantle txhash)
signatures: list[Ed25519Signature]
indexes: list[u16]                 # for each signature, the index in `keys` of
                                   # the signing key
keys: list[Ed25519PublicKey]       # the accredited keys
threshold: u16                     # the number of required signatures
```

*Verify*

```python
def MultiEd25519_verify(msg, signatures, indexes, keys, threshold):
    # There must be exactly one index per signature
    assert len(signatures) == len(indexes)

    # There must be exactly `threshold` signatures
    assert len(signatures) == threshold

    # Indexes must be ordered from smallest to biggest without duplication.
    # Being strictly increasing rejects duplicates and, since `idx` is used to
    # index `keys`, guarantees every index stays within bounds.
    for i in range(len(indexes) - 1):
        assert indexes[i] < indexes[i + 1]

    # Each signature must be valid for the accredited key at its index
    for sig, idx in zip(signatures, indexes):
        assert Ed25519_verify(msg, keys[idx], sig)
```

## Proof of Claim

A proof attesting that given these public values:

```python
class ProofOfClaimPublic:
    voucher_root: zkhash # Merkle root of the reward_voucher maintained by everyone
    voucher_nullifier: zkhash
    mantle_tx_hash_fr: zkhash # attached hash reduced modulo p
```

The prover knows the following witness:

```python
class ProofOfClaimWitness:
    secret_voucher: zkhash
    voucher_merkle_path: list[zkhash]
    voucher_merkle_path_selectors: list[bool]
```

such that the following constraints hold:

- The reward voucher is derived from the secret voucher.
```python
assert reward_voucher == zkhash(
    FiniteField(b"REWARD_VOUCHER", byte_order="little", modulus= p),
    secret_voucher)
```

- There exists a valid Merkle path from the reward voucher as a leaf to the Merkle root.
```python
assert voucher_root == path_root(leaf=reward_voucher,
    path=voucher_merkle_path,
    selectors=voucher_merkle_path_selectors)
```

- The voucher nullifier is derived from the secret voucher correctly.
```python
assert voucher_nullifier == zkhash(
    FiniteField(b"VOUCHER_NF", byte_order="little", modulus= p),
    secret_voucher)
```

- The proof is bound to the `mantle_tx_hash` reduced modulo $`p`$.

## Test Vectors

To see what the payloads represent, refer to [Mantle Transaction Encoding](mantle-transaction-encoding.md).

The `SDP_WITHDRAW` payload changed with this revision, so its `op_id` and the hash of the transaction carrying it are marked `TBD` until they are regenerated from the encoding.

# Introduction

This document specifies the canonical encoding of Mantle transactions (see [\[1.5.0\] Mantle - Mantle Transaction](bedrock-v1.1-mantle-specification.md)) and its sub-components. Transactions sent through the mempool and included in blocks use this encoding.

# Overview

The transaction encoding is specified in ABNF form to remove any ambiguity and guarantee a canonical encoding. The high level encoding choices which were not immediately derivable from the Mantle specification are listed here:

1. All multi-byte integers use little-endian encoding
1. Any lists are length-prefixed with fixed width uints
1. We derive number of proofs and type of proof from the Ops list parsed earlier

# Specification

## Signed Mantle Tx

```text
SignedMantleTx = MantleTx OpsProofs
```

## Mantle Tx

```text
MantleTx = OpCount *Op
OpCount = Byte
```

## Operations

```text
Op = Opcode OpPayload
Opcode = Byte
OpPayload = Transfer /
ChannelInscribe /
ChannelConfig /
ChannelDeposit /
ChannelWithdraw /
SDPDeclare /
SDPWithdraw /
SDPActive /
LeaderClaim 
```

### Channel Operations

```text
ChannelInscribe = ChannelId Inscription Parent Signer
Inscription = UINT32 *BYTE 
ChannelConfig = ChannelId KeyCount *Signer PostingTimeframe PostingTimeout ConfigThreshold WithdrawThreshold
KeyCount = UINT16
PostingTimeframe = UINT32
PostingTimeout = UINT32
ConfigThreshold = UINT16
WithdrawThreshold = UINT16
ChannelDeposit = ChannelId Inputs Metadata
Inputs = InputCount *NoteId
InputCount = Byte
Metadata = UINT32 *BYTE

ChannelWithdraw = ChannelId Outputs WithdrawNonce
Outputs = OutputCount *Note
OutputCount = Byte
WithdrawNonce = UINT32
ChannelId = Hash32
Parent = Hash32
Signer = Ed25519PublicKey
```

### SDP Operations

```text
SDPDeclare = ServiceType LocatorCount *Locator ProviderId ZkId LockedNoteId
ServiceType = Byte ; 0 = BN
LocatorCount = Byte ; Max 8
Locator = 2Byte *BYTE ; Max 329 bytes, multiaddr format
ProviderId = Ed25519PublicKey
ZkId = ZkPublicKey
LockedNoteId = NoteId
SDPWithdraw = DeclarationId Nonce LockedNoteId
DeclarationId = Hash32
Nonce = UINT64
SDPActive = DeclarationId Nonce Metadata
Metadata = UINT32 *BYTE ; Service-specific node activeness metadata
```

### Leader operations

```text
LeaderClaim = RewardsRoot VoucherNullifier PublicKey
RewardsRoot = FieldElement ; Merkle root for voucher membership proof
VoucherNullifier = FieldElement
PublicKey = ZkPublicKey
```

### Transfer Operations

```text
Transfer = Inputs Outputs
Inputs = InputCount *NoteId
InputCount = Byte
Outputs = OutputCount *Note
OutputCount = Byte
```

## Ledger

```text
Note = Value ZkPublicKey
Value = UINT64
NoteId = FieldElement
```

## Op Proofs

```text
OpsProofs = *OpProof ; 1. Lenth must equal OpCount
; 2. OpProof variant is derived from the corresponding Op.
; That is, type(OpProofs[i]) == ProofFor(Op[i])
OpProof = Ed25519SigProof /
ZkSigProof /
ZkAndEd25519SigsProof /
ChannelWithdrawOpProof /
ProofOfClaimProof
Ed25519SigProof = Ed25519Signature
ZkSigProof = ZkSignature
ZkAndEd25519SigsProof = ZkSignature Ed25519Signature
ChannelWithdrawOpProof = SignatureCount *Ed25519Signature
ProofOfClaimProof = Groth16
SignatureCount = UINT16
```

## Common Structures

```text
; Zero-knowledge signature
ZkSignature = Groth16
; Cryptographic primitives
Groth16 = 128BYTE      ; pi_a (32) + pi_b (64) + pi_c (32)
ZkPublicKey = FieldElement
Ed25519PublicKey = 32BYTE
Ed25519Signature = 64BYTE
FieldElement = 32BYTE       ; BN254 field element (little-endian)
Hash32 = 32BYTE

; Primitive types
UINT64 = 8BYTE ; 64-bit unsigned integer, little-endian
UINT32 = 4BYTE ; 32-bit unsigned integer, little-endian
UINT16 = 2BYTE ; 16-bit unsigned integer, little-endian
Byte = OCTET
```

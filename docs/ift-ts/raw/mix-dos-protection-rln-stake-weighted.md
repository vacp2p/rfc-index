## Abstract

This document specifies a registration policy extension for the [RLN Per-Hop DoS Protection](./mix-dos-protection-rln.md) specification,
introducing stake-proportional rate limits for mix nodes.
Under this extension,
each node's rate limit is proportional to its committed stake
and enforced via the RLN-Diff circuit defined in [RLN-v2](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index/blob/dabc31786b4a4ca704ebcd1105239faff7ac2b47/vac/raw/rln-v2.md).
The mapping is Sybil-resistant,
requires no circuit changes,
and enforces rate differentiation entirely through the membership registry.

## 1. Introduction

The [RLN Per-Hop DoS Protection](./mix-dos-protection-rln.md) assigns a flat rate limit to all mix nodes that meet a minimum stake requirement.
To accommodate high-capacity relay nodes,
this limit must be set high &mdash;
making the same rate headroom available to any minimally-staked attacker.
This structural limitation is referred to as the rate amplification gap,
defined in [Section 3.1](#31-rate-amplification-gap).

This document specifies an extension that replaces this flat limit with a stake-proportional mapping:
a node claiming a higher rate must commit proportionally more stake.
This raises the economic cost of exploiting the gap
but does not eliminate it.

[Section 2](#2-terminology) defines terms used in this specification.
[Section 3](#3-background) provides background on the rate amplification gap and RLN-Diff.
[Section 4](#4-approach) specifies the stake-to-rate mapping, registration, and verification mechanics.
[Section 5](#5-security-and-privacy-considerations) covers security and privacy considerations.
[Section 6](#6-out-of-scope) defines scope boundaries.
[Section 7](#7-future-work) identifies limitations and future directions.

## 2. Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

The following terms are used throughout this specification.
Other terms are as defined in the [Mix Protocol](./mix.md),
[Mix DoS Protection](./mix-dos-protection.md),
[RLN Per-Hop DoS Protection](./mix-dos-protection-rln.md),
[RLN-v1](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index/blob/dabc31786b4a4ca704ebcd1105239faff7ac2b47/vac/32/rln-v1.md),

- **`S_unit`**: The stake required per message per epoch.
  A system-wide constant defined at deployment time.

- **`R_base`**: The flat per-node rate limit per epoch on outgoing packets,
  referred to as the messaging rate in [RLN Per-Hop DoS Protection](./mix-dos-protection-rln.md).

- **`T`**: The stake tier size, a deployment-defined positive integer.
  Each tier corresponds to a stake increment of `T × S_unit`
  and a rate increment of `T`.

- **`R_min`**: The minimum rate limit a node may be registered with.
  `R_min` is the smallest multiple of `T` greater than or equal to `R_base`.
  `R_min = ⌈R_base / T⌉ × T`.

- **`R_max`**: The maximum rate limit any node may be assigned, regardless of stake,
  expressed as `f × R_base` where `f ≥ 1` is a deployment-defined multiplier.
  `R_max` MUST be a multiple of `T`.

- **floor-stake**: The minimum stake required to register, `R_min × S_unit`.
  Nodes with stake below floor-stake are rejected at registration.

- **Membership**: The result of a single node registration, backed by one stake deposit.
  Each node holds exactly one membership.

- **Sybil-resistant**: A property of a stake-based membership mechanism in which registering `N` nodes requires `N` times the stake of one,
  ensuring no rate advantage from splitting stake across multiple nodes.

## 3. Background

This section provides background on the rate amplification gap in [RLN Per-Hop DoS Protection](./mix-dos-protection-rln.md)
and on RLN-Diff.

### 3.1 Rate Amplification Gap

[RLN Per-Hop DoS Protection](./mix-dos-protection-rln.md) enforces a flat rate limit `R_base` per node per epoch on outgoing packets.
Two properties combine to make this exploitable:

- `R_base` must be set high enough to accommodate the forwarding load of high-capacity relay nodes.
  As a result, all nodes receive the same high `R_base` regardless of stake.
- The [Mix Protocol](./mix.md)'s unlinkability guarantees make forwarded and originated packets cryptographically indistinguishable by design,
  so any node can use its `R_base` allowance entirely for origination.

Together, these give a minimally-staked attacker the same effective origination budget
as the forwarding budget intended for a high-capacity honest relay.

Raising `R_base` to accommodate higher-capacity relays widens this budget proportionally.
This structural limitation is referred to as the rate amplification gap.

### 3.2 RLN-Diff

[Rate Limiting Nullifiers (RLN)](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index/blob/dabc31786b4a4ca704ebcd1105239faff7ac2b47/vac/raw/rln-v2.md) is a zero-knowledge construct that allows message rate limits to be set
and cryptographically enforced for members of a group,
without revealing their identity.
This specification uses the RLN-Diff variant,
which supports per-member rate limits set individually at registration.
The full mechanics are defined in [RLN-v2](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index/blob/dabc31786b4a4ca704ebcd1105239faff7ac2b47/vac/raw/rln-v2.md);
only the parts required to follow [Section 4.2](#42-registration) and [Section 5](#5-security-and-privacy-considerations) are summarised below.

**Registration**:
A member generates an `identity_secret`
and derives `id_commitment = Poseidon(identity_secret)`.
It submits `id_commitment` and a `user_message_limit` to the membership registry.

The registry writes a Merkle leaf encoding both as a `rate_commitment`:

```text
rate_commitment = Poseidon(id_commitment, user_message_limit)
```

`user_message_limit` is observable to any party that can read the registry.

**Rate limit**:
Each member's rate is bounded by the `user_message_limit` set at registration.
For each outgoing packet,
a member selects an unused `message_id` in `[1, user_message_limit]` for the current epoch
and generates an RLN-Diff proof.
The proof binds the packet to that `message_id` and epoch,
attests that the member holds a `rate_commitment` in the Merkle tree,
and enforces `message_id ≤ user_message_limit` via a range constraint.

`user_message_limit` is not revealed by the proof.

**Double-signalling and slashing**:
Reusing the same `message_id` with different signals in an epoch allows any verifier to reconstruct the member's `identity_secret`
and slash its stake.

## 4. Approach

This specification raises the economic cost of exploiting the rate amplification gap defined in [Section 3.1](#31-rate-amplification-gap),
by tying rate limits to committed stake.

The approach mirrors bandwidth-weighted relay selection in Tor,
where relays are assigned traffic proportional to their capacity.
The analogue here is economic:
stake functions as a commitment to capacity,
and rate limits scale accordingly.

The following sections specify the mapping, registration, and verification mechanics.

### 4.1 Mapping Function

A node's rate limit `user_message_limit` is computed from its registered stake `S` as follows:

```text
user_message_limit = min( ⌊ S / (T × S_unit) ⌋ × T, R_max )
```

Setting `T = 1` reduces the mapping to fully linear `⌊ S / S_unit ⌋`.

The integer `t = ⌊ S / (T × S_unit) ⌋` is the stake tier index.
All stake amounts that map to the same `t` have `user_message_limit = t × T`.

This mapping MUST be computed and enforced by the membership registry at the time of registration.
It MUST NOT be modifiable after registration without re-registration.

**Rationale for linear mapping**:
Any linear mapping `g` of stakes is additive: `g(S₁) + g(S₂) = g(S₁ + S₂)`,
meaning an attacker gains no aggregate rate by splitting stake across multiple registrations.
This makes linear mapping Sybil-resistant.
The quantized form used in this spec retains additivity at tier boundaries:
stakes that are exact multiples of `T × S_unit` are additive;
stakes between tier boundaries round down without any rate advantage.

### 4.2 Registration

The node generates an `identity_secret` and derives `id_commitment`,
as described in [Section 3.2](#32-rln-diff).
It submits `id_commitment` and stake `S` to the registry.

The membership registry MUST enforce the following at the time of registration:

1. Verify that `S ≥ R_min × S_unit`.
   Reject registrations below floor-stake.
2. Compute `user_message_limit` from `S` according to [Section 4.1](#41-mapping-function).
3. Complete registration as described in [Section 3.2](#32-rln-diff) using the computed `user_message_limit`.
4. Lock the stake for the duration of membership.
   Stake MUST NOT be withdrawable while membership is active.

Stake top-ups MUST NOT be accepted while a membership is active.
Any change in stake requires deregistration followed by re-registration.

### 4.3 Packet Sending and Verification

Packet sending follows the rate limit and double-signalling mechanics described in [Section 3.2](#32-rln-diff).
The node selects a `message_id` in `[1, user_message_limit]` that has not been used in the current epoch
and generates an RLN-Diff proof.

`user_message_limit` is not revealed by proofs;
verifiers only learn that the sender has not exceeded their registered limit.

All per-hop verification and slashing logic are as defined in [RLN Per-Hop DoS Protection](./mix-dos-protection-rln.md).

### 4.4 System Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `S_unit` | Stake required per message per epoch. Deployment-defined. |
| `T` | Stake tier size, `T ≥ 1`. Granularity at which stakes cluster. |
| `R_min` | Minimum rate, `R_min = ⌈R_base / T⌉ × T`. Nodes with stake `S < R_min × S_unit` MUST be rejected. |
| `R_max` | `f × R_base`. Maximum rate regardless of stake. MUST be a multiple of `T`. |
| `f` | Deployment multiplier `f ≥ 1`. Controls the maximum rate relative to the base rate. |

`S_unit` SHOULD be set such that a floor-stake node generating only mandatory cover traffic at the rate specified in [Mix Cover Traffic](./mix-cover-traffic.md)
can sustain operation at `R_min`.

`f` MUST be set such that a single node operating at `R_max` cannot individually saturate the network's forwarding capacity.
`f = 10` is a reasonable starting point:
it allows a high-stake operator to handle `10×` the base forwarding load without dominating the network.
Values above `f = 50` SHOULD be avoided without careful analysis of the deployment's expected node count and forwarding load distribution.

`T = 1` provides full rate granularity.
Deployments concerned with registered-stake privacy SHOULD use `T ≥ 10`;
see [Section 5.3](#53-registered-stake-privacy).

`S_unit`, `R_base`, `T`, `R_min`, `R_max`, and `f` MUST be published in a deployment configuration accessible to all participants
before the network accepts registrations.
The membership registry MUST reject registrations inconsistent with the published parameters.
Verifiers trust the membership registry to enforce the correct value of these parameters at registration time.

### 4.5 Cover Traffic Budget

Cover emission under this mechanism follows [Mix Cover Traffic](./mix-cover-traffic.md):
the deployment-wide cover budget `R_cover = f_cover × R_base` is uniform across all nodes,
where `f_cover ∈ (0.0, 1.0]` is the `cover_rate_fraction` defined by the cover traffic specification
(distinct from the `f` parameter in [Section 4.4](#44-system-parameters) of this specification).
Per-node capacity in `(R_base, R_max]` is intentionally unused for cover
and is exclusively available to non-cover origination and forwarding.
The rationale for uniform `R_cover` &mdash; preventing high-`user_message_limit` nodes
from overwhelming low-`user_message_limit` forwarders under uniform random path selection &mdash;
is detailed in [Mix Cover Traffic §4](./mix-cover-traffic.md#4-rate-limit-budget-model).

## 5. Security and Privacy Considerations

### 5.1 Sybil-Resistance

The stake-to-rate mapping is Sybil-resistant:
each rate increment of `T` costs `T × S_unit` of stake,
regardless of how that stake is distributed across registrations.

For any partition of stake `S` across `N` nodes with individual stakes `S_1, ..., S_N` (∑ `S_i = S`),
the aggregate `user_message_limit` satisfies:

```text
∑ ⌊ S_i / (T × S_unit) ⌋ × T  ≤  ⌊ S / (T × S_unit) ⌋ × T
```

Splitting stake across nodes cannot produce more aggregate `user_message_limit` than a single registration with equal total stake.
Equality holds when each `S_i` is an exact multiple of `T × S_unit`.

The above holds for stake up to `R_max × S_unit` per node.
Above this ceiling,
the per-node `R_max` cap creates a residual incentive to register across additional nodes &mdash;
each further `R_max × S_unit` of stake can claim an additional `R_max` of rate by registering a new node.
Each additional registration also incurs transaction fees and coordination overhead,
providing an economic deterrent beyond the protocol guarantee.

### 5.2 Residual Rate Amplification Gap

The stake-to-rate mapping raises the economic cost of exploiting the rate amplification gap defined in [Section 3.1](#31-rate-amplification-gap),
but does not eliminate the gap.
A malicious node that wants a high message rate must commit proportionally more stake,
which is subject to slashing on detection.

The gap is structural:
the [Mix Protocol](./mix.md) unlinkability guarantees make forwarding and origination indistinguishable,
so any forwarding rate allowance is simultaneously an origination budget.
This is an explicitly acknowledged limitation of per-hop RLN regardless of the rate mapping function.

### 5.3 Registered-Stake Privacy

**Proof layer**:
`user_message_limit` is a private witness in the RLN-Diff circuit.
All proofs are structurally identical regardless of the sender's registered rate,
and an observer cannot link a proof to a specific registered stake.

**Registry layer**:
Registration is publicly observable.
It reveals a node's stake amount,
the resulting `user_message_limit` (see [Section 4.1](#41-mapping-function)),
and any associated identifying metadata (_e.g.,_ wallet address) depending on the registration mechanism.

A node's rate is also observable at the network layer from its traffic.
When this rate matches only one registration's `user_message_limit`,
an observer can link the node's network identity to that registration's identifying metadata.

The stake tier size `T` mitigates this by clustering registered rates at multiples of `T`.
With `T ≥ 10`, the rate space is coarser,
increasing the likelihood of multiple stakers sharing the same `user_message_limit`,
thereby forming anonymity sets at the registry layer.
Actual anonymity set size depends on how stakers are distributed across tiers.

A complete fix at the registry layer requires a shielded membership registry that hides the stake-to-identity link via ZK
(see [Section 7](#7-future-work)).

## 6. Out of Scope

The following are explicitly out of scope for this specification:

- Dynamic rate adjustment without re-registration
- Reputation-based rate multipliers
- Stake token selection and blockchain infrastructure
- Detailed migration procedures and tooling for networks upgrading from flat-rate RLN
- Voluntary deregistration mechanisms (a [RLN Per-Hop DoS Protection](./mix-dos-protection-rln.md) responsibility)
- Membership registry implementation (smart contract, coordination layer, or other)
- **Rate-weighted path selection.**
  This specification preserves the uniform random path selection defined in the [Mix Protocol](./mix.md).

  The trade-off is genuine.
  Path-selection rules only constrain honest senders,
  so attackers can target low-stake nodes under either strategy.
  Under uniform random selection,
  every honest path that includes at least one low-stake node is affected by such flooding.
  Weighting selection proportional to registered rates &mdash; similar to Tor &mdash; would blunt this
  by biasing honest paths toward high-rate nodes.

  It is nonetheless out of scope here.
  Well-funded adversaries can stake more to gain disproportionate path inclusion,
  concentrating forwarding through nodes they control
  and creating surveillance hotspots that defeat the mixnet's anonymity goal.
  A future specification MAY revisit this trade-off.

## 7. Future Work

- **Shielded Membership Registry**:
  The registration publicly reveals the node's effective rate.
  A shielded membership registry &mdash; where the stake-to-identity link is concealed via ZK &mdash; would close this gap.
  One approach is multi-identity registration:
  a node registers multiple unit-rate identities,
  hiding its total rate from registry observers.
  However, slashing requires linking all identities to the committed stake:
  double-signalling on any identity must make the entire stake slashable.
  Achieving such an unlinkable registration with linked slashing requires circuit-level changes not available in current RLN-v2.

- **Dynamic stake top-up**:
  A mechanism for incrementally increasing stake without full deregistration would improve operational ergonomics.

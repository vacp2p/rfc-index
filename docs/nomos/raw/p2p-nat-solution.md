## Abstract

This specification defines a comprehensive NAT (Network Address Translation) traversal solution for the Nomos P2P network. The solution enables nodes to automatically determine their NAT status and establish both outbound and inbound connections regardless of network configuration. The strategy combines [AutoNAT](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/autonat/autonat-v2.md), dynamic port mapping protocols, and continuous verification to maximize public reachability while maintaining decentralized operation.

## Motivation

Network Address Translation presents a critical challenge for Nomos participants, particularly those operating on consumer hardware without technical expertise. The Nomos network requires a NAT traversal solution that:

1. **Automatic Operation**: Works out-of-the-box without user configuration
2. **Inclusive Participation**: Enables nodes on consumer hardware to participate effectively
3. **Decentralized Approach**: Leverages the existing Nomos P2P network rather than centralized services
4. **Progressive Fallback**: Escalates through increasingly complex protocols as needed
5. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Handles changing network environments and configurations

The solution must ensure that nodes can both establish outbound connections and accept inbound connections from other peers, maintaining network connectivity across diverse NAT configurations.

## Specification

### Terminology

- **Public Node**: A node that is publicly reachable via a public IP address or valid port mapping
- **Private Node**: A node that is not publicly reachable due to NAT/firewall restrictions
- **Dialing**: The process of establishing a connection using the [libp2p protocol](https://docs.libp2p.io/) stack
- **NAT Status**: Whether a node is publicly reachable or hidden behind NAT

### Key Design Principles

#### Optional Configuration

The NAT traversal strategy must work out-of-the-box whenever possible. Users who do not want to engage in configuration should only need to install the node software package. However, users requiring full control must be able to configure every aspect of the strategy.

#### Decentralized Operation

The solution leverages the existing Nomos P2P network for coordination rather than relying on centralized third-party services. This maintains the decentralized nature of the network while providing necessary NAT traversal capabilities.

#### Progressive Fallback

The protocol begins with lightweight checks and escalates through more complex and resource-intensive protocols. Failure at any step moves the protocol to the next stage in the strategy, ensuring maximum compatibility across network configurations.

#### Dynamic Network Environment

Unless explicitly configured for static addresses, each node's public or private status is assumed to be dynamic. A once publicly-reachable node can become unreachable and vice versa, requiring continuous monitoring and adaptation.

### Node Discovery Considerations

The Nomos public network encourages participation from a large number of nodes, many deployed through simple installation procedures. Some nodes will not achieve Public status, but the discovery protocol must track these peers and allow other nodes to discover them. This prevents network partitioning and ensures Private nodes remain accessible to other participants.

### NAT Traversal Protocol

#### Protocol Requirements

**Each node MUST:**

- Run an [AutoNAT](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/autonat/autonat-v2.md) client, except for nodes statically configured as Public
- Use the [Identify protocol](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/identify/README.md) to advertise support for:
  - `/nomos/autonat/2/dial-request` for main network
  - `/nomos-testnet/autonat/2/dial-request` for public testnet
  - `/nomos/autonat/2/dial-back` and `/nomos-testnet/autonat/2/dial-back` respectively

#### NAT State Machine

The NAT traversal process follows a multi-phase state machine:

```mermaid
graph TD
  Start@{shape: circle, label: "Start"} -->|Preconfigured public IP or port mapping| StaticPublic[Statically configured as<br/>**Public**]
  subgraph Phase0 [Phase 0]
  Start -->|Default configuration| Boot
  end
  subgraph Phase1 [Phase 1]
  Boot[Bootstrap and discover AutoNAT servers]--> Inspect
  Inspect[Inspect own IP addresses]-->|At least 1 IP address in the public range| ConfirmPublic[AutoNAT]
  end
  subgraph Phase2 [Phase 2]
  Inspect -->|No IP addresses in the public range| MapPorts[Port Mapping Client<br/>UPnP/NAT-PMP/PCP]
  MapPorts -->|Successful port map| ConfirmMapPorts[AutoNAT]
  end
  ConfirmPublic -->|Node's IP address reachable by AutoNAT server| Public[**Public** Node]
  ConfirmPublic -->|Node's IP address not reachable by AutoNAT server or Timeout| MapPorts
  ConfirmMapPorts -->|Mapped IP address and port reachable by AutoNAT server| Public
  ConfirmMapPorts -->|Mapped IP address and port not reachable by AutoNAT server or Timeout| Private
  MapPorts -->|Failure or Timeout| Private[**Private** Node]
  subgraph Phase3 [Phase 3]
  Public -->Monitor
  Private --> Monitor
  end
  Monitor[Network Monitoring] -->|Restart| Inspect
```

### Phase Implementation

#### Phase 0: Bootstrapping and Identifying Public Nodes

If the node is statically configured by the operator to be Public, the procedure stops here.

The node utilizes bootstrapping and discovery mechanisms to find other Public nodes. The [Identify protocol](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/identify/README.md) confirms which detected Public nodes support [AutoNAT v2](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/autonat/autonat-v2.md).

#### Phase 1: NAT Detection

The node starts an [AutoNAT](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/autonat/autonat-v2.md) client and inspects its own addresses. For each public IP address, the node verifies public reachability via [AutoNAT](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/autonat/autonat-v2.md). If any public IP addresses are confirmed, the node assumes Public status and moves to Phase 3. Otherwise, it continues to Phase 2.

#### Phase 2: Automated Port Mapping

The node attempts to secure port mapping on the default gateway using:

- **[PCP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6887)** (Port Control Protocol) - Most reliable
- **[NAT-PMP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6886)** (NAT Port Mapping Protocol) - Second most reliable  
- **[UPnP-IGD](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6970)** (Universal Plug and Play Internet Gateway Device) - Most widely deployed

**Port Mapping Algorithm:**

```python
def try_port_mapping():
    # Step 1: Get the local IPv4 address
    local_ip = get_local_ipv4_address()
    
    # Step 2: Get the default gateway IPv4 address
    gateway_ip = get_default_gateway_address()
    
    # Step 3: Abort if local or gateway IP could not be determined
    if not local_ip or not gateway_ip:
        return "Mapping failed: Unable to get local or gateway IPv4"

    # Step 4: Probe the gateway for protocol support
    supports_pcp = probe_pcp(gateway_ip)
    supports_nat_pmp = probe_nat_pmp(gateway_ip)
    supports_upnp = probe_upnp(gateway_ip)  # Optional for logging

    # Step 5-9: Try protocols in order of reliability
    # PCP (most reliable) -> NAT-PMP -> UPnP -> fallback attempts
    
    protocols = [
        (supports_pcp, try_pcp_mapping),
        (supports_nat_pmp, try_nat_pmp_mapping),
        (True, try_upnp_mapping),  # Always try UPnP
        (not supports_pcp, try_pcp_mapping),  # Fallback
        (not supports_nat_pmp, try_nat_pmp_mapping)  # Last resort
    ]
    
    for supported, mapping_func in protocols:
        if supported:
            mapping = mapping_func(local_ip, gateway_ip)
            if mapping:
                return mapping
    
    return "Mapping failed: No protocol succeeded"
```

If mapping succeeds, the node uses [AutoNAT](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/autonat/autonat-v2.md) to confirm public reachability. Upon confirmation, the node assumes Public status. Otherwise, it assumes Private status.

**Port Mapping Sequence:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    box Node
        participant AutoNAT Client
        participant NAT State Machine
        participant Port Mapping Client
    end
    participant Router
    
    alt Mapping is successful
        Note left of AutoNAT Client: Phase 2
        Port Mapping Client ->> +Router: Requests new mapping
        Router ->> Port Mapping Client: Confirms new mapping
        Port Mapping Client ->> NAT State Machine: Mapping secured
        NAT State Machine ->> AutoNAT Client: Requests confirmation<br/>that mapped address<br/>is publicly reachable
        
        alt Node asserts Public status
            AutoNAT Client ->> NAT State Machine: Mapped address<br/>is publicly reachable
            Note left of AutoNAT Client: Phase 3<br/>Network Monitoring
        else Node asserts Private status
            AutoNAT Client ->> NAT State Machine: Mapped address<br/>is not publicly reachable
            Note left of AutoNAT Client: Phase 3<br/>Network Monitoring
        end
    else Mapping fails, node asserts Private status
        Note left of AutoNAT Client: Phase 2
        Port Mapping Client ->> Router: Requests new mapping
        Router ->> Port Mapping Client: Refuses new mapping or Timeout
        Port Mapping Client ->> NAT State Machine: Mapping failed
        Note left of AutoNAT Client: Phase 3<br/>Network Monitoring
    end
```

#### Phase 3: Network Monitoring

Unless explicitly configured, nodes must monitor their network status and restart from Phase 1 when changes are detected.

**Public Node Monitoring:**

A Public node must restart when:

- [AutoNAT](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/autonat/autonat-v2.md) client no longer confirms public reachability
- A previously successful port mapping is lost or refresh fails

**Private Node Monitoring:**

A Private node must restart when:

- It gains a new public IP address
- Port mapping is likely to succeed (gateway change, sufficient time passed)

**Network Monitoring Sequence:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant AutoNAT Server
    box Node
        participant AutoNAT Client
        participant NAT State Machine
        participant Port Mapping Client
    end
    participant Router

    Note left of AutoNAT Server: Phase 3<br/>Network Monitoring
    par Refresh mapping and monitor changes
        loop periodically refreshes mapping
            Port Mapping Client ->> Router: Requests refresh
            Router ->> Port Mapping Client: Confirms mapping refresh
        end
        break Mapping is lost, the node loses Public status
            Router ->> Port Mapping Client: Refresh failed or mapping dropped
            Port Mapping Client ->> NAT State Machine: Mapping lost
            NAT State Machine ->> NAT State Machine: Restart
        end
    and Monitor public reachability of mapped addresses
        loop periodically checks public reachability
            AutoNAT Client ->> AutoNAT Server: Requests dialback
            AutoNAT Server ->> AutoNAT Client: Dialback successful
        end
        break
            AutoNAT Server ->> AutoNAT Client: Dialback failed or Timeout
            AutoNAT Client ->> NAT State Machine: Public reachability lost
            NAT State Machine ->> NAT State Machine: Restart
        end
    end
    Note left of AutoNAT Server: Phase 1
```

### Public Node Responsibilities

**A Public node MUST:**

- Run an [AutoNAT](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/autonat/autonat-v2.md) server
- Listen on and advertise via [Identify protocol](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/identify/README.md) its publicly reachable [multiaddresses](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/addressing/README.md):
  
  `/{public_peer_ip}/udp/{port}/quic-v1/p2p/{public_peer_id}`

- Periodically renew port mappings according to protocol recommendations
- Maintain high availability for [AutoNAT](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/autonat/autonat-v2.md) services

### Peer Dialing

Other peers can always dial a Public peer using its publicly reachable [multiaddresses](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/addressing/README.md):

`/{public_peer_ip}/udp/{port}/quic-v1/p2p/{public_peer_id}`

## Implementation Requirements

### Mandatory Components

All Nomos nodes MUST implement:

1. **[AutoNAT](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/autonat/autonat-v2.md) client** for NAT status detection
2. **Port mapping clients** for [PCP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6887), [NAT-PMP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6886), and [UPnP-IGD](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6970)
3. **[Identify protocol](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/identify/README.md)** for capability advertisement
4. **Network monitoring** for status change detection

### Optional Enhancements

Nodes MAY implement:

- Custom port mapping retry strategies
- Enhanced network change detection
- Advanced [AutoNAT](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/autonat/autonat-v2.md) server load balancing
- Backup connectivity mechanisms

## Security Considerations

### NAT Traversal Security

1. **Port Mapping Validation**: Verify that requested port mappings are actually created
2. **[AutoNAT](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/autonat/autonat-v2.md) Server Trust**: Implement peer reputation for [AutoNAT](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/autonat/autonat-v2.md) servers
3. **Gateway Communication**: Secure communication with NAT devices
4. **Address Validation**: Validate public addresses before advertisement

### Privacy Considerations

1. **IP Address Exposure**: Public nodes necessarily expose IP addresses
2. **Traffic Analysis**: Monitor for patterns that could reveal node behavior
3. **Gateway Information**: Minimize exposure of internal network topology

### Denial of Service Protection

1. **[AutoNAT](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/autonat/autonat-v2.md) Rate Limiting**: Implement request throttling for [AutoNAT](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/autonat/autonat-v2.md) services
2. **Port Mapping Abuse**: Prevent excessive port mapping requests
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: Limit concurrent NAT traversal attempts

## Performance Characteristics

### Scalability

- **[AutoNAT](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/autonat/autonat-v2.md) Server Load**: Distributed across Public nodes
- **Port Mapping Overhead**: Minimal ongoing resource usage
- **Network Monitoring**: Efficient periodic checks

### Reliability

- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple protocols ensure high success rates
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Automatic recovery from connectivity loss
- **Protocol Redundancy**: Multiple port mapping protocols increase reliability

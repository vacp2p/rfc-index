`27/WAKU2-PEERS` describes a recommended minimal set of peer storage and
peer management features to be implemented by Waku v2 clients.

In this context, peer _storage_ refers to a client's ability to keep track of discovered
or statically-configured peers and their metadata.
It also deals with matters of peer _persistence_,
or the ability to store peer data on disk to resume state after a client restart.

Peer _management_ is a closely related concept and
refers to the set of actions a client MAY choose to perform
based on its knowledge of its connected peers,
e.g. triggering reconnects/disconnects,
keeping certain connections alive, etc.

## Peer store

The peer store SHOULD be an in-memory data structure
where information about discovered or configured peers are stored.
It SHOULD be considered the main source of truth
for peer-related information in a Waku v2 client.
Clients MAY choose to persist this store on-disk.

### Tracked peer metadata

It is RECOMMENDED that a Waku v2 client tracks at least the following information
about each of its peers in a peer store:

| Metadata | Description  |
| --- | --- |
| _Public key_  | The public key for this peer. This is related to the libp2p [`Peer ID`](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/peer-id/). |
| _Addresses_ | Known transport layer [`multiaddrs`](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/addressing/) for this peer. |
| _Protocols_ | The libp2p [`protocol IDs`](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/protocols/#protocol-ids) supported by this peer. This can be used to track the client's connectivity to peers supporting different Waku v2 protocols, e.g. [`11/WAKU2-RELAY`](../../standards/core/11/relay.md) or [`13/WAKU2-STORE`](../../standards/core/13/store.md). |
| _Connectivity_ | Tracks the peer's current connectedness state. See [**Peer connectivity**](#peer-connectivity) below. |
| _Disconnect time_ | The timestamp at which this peer last disconnected. This becomes important when managing [peer reconnections](#reconnecting-peers) |

### Peer connectivity

A Waku v2 client SHOULD track _at least_ the following connectivity states
for each of its peers:

- **`NotConnected`**: The peer has been discovered or configured on this client,
 but no attempt has yet been made to connect to this peer.
 This is the default state for a new peer.
- **`CannotConnect`**: The client attempted to connect to this peer, but failed.
- **`CanConnect`**: The client was recently connected to this peer and
disconnected gracefully.
- **`Connected`**: The client is actively connected to this peer.

This list does not preclude clients from tracking more advanced connectivity metadata,
such as a peer's blacklist status (see [`18/WAKU2-SWAP`](/messaging/deprecated/18/swap.md)).

### Persistence

A Waku v2 client MAY choose to persist peers across restarts,
using any offline storage technology, such as an on-disk database.
Peer persistence MAY be used to resume peer connections after a client restart.

## Peer management

Waku v2 clients will have different requirements
when it comes to managing the peers tracked in the [**peer store**](#peer-store).
It is RECOMMENDED that clients support:

- [automatic reconnection](#reconnecting-peers) to peers under certain conditions
- [connection keep-alive](#connection-keep-alive)

### Reconnecting peers

A Waku v2 client MAY choose to reconnect to previously connected,
managed peers under certain conditions.
Such conditions include, but are not limited to:

- Reconnecting to all `relay`-capable peers after a client restart.
This will require [persistent peer storage](#persistence).

If a client chooses to automatically reconnect to previous peers,
it MUST respect the
[backing off period](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pubsub/gossipsub/gossipsub-v1.1.md#prune-backoff-and-peer-exchange)
specified for GossipSub v1.1 before attempting to reconnect.
This requires keeping track of the [last time each peer was disconnected](#tracked-peer-metadata).

### Connection keep-alive

A Waku v2 client MAY choose to implement a keep-alive mechanism to certain peers.
If a client chooses to implement keep-alive on a connection,
it SHOULD do so by sending periodic [libp2p pings](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/fundamentals/protocols/#ping)
as per `10/WAKU2` [client recommendations](/messaging/standards/core/10/waku2.md#recommendations-for-clients).
The recommended period between pings SHOULD be _at most_ 50%
of the shortest idle connection timeout for the specific client and transport.
For example, idle TCP connections often times out after 10 to 15 minutes.

> **Implementation note:**
the `nim-waku` client currently implements a keep-alive mechanism every `5 minutes`,
in response to a TCP connection timeout of `10 minutes`.

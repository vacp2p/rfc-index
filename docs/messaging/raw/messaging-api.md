## Abstract

This document specifies an Application Programming Interface (API) that is RECOMMENDED for developers of the [WAKU2](https://github.com/logos-co/logos-lips/blob/7b443c1aab627894e3f22f5adfbb93f4c4eac4f6/waku/standards/core/10/waku2.md) clients to implement,
and for consumers to use as a single entry point to its functionalities.

This API defines the RECOMMENDED interface for leveraging Logos Messaging protocols to send and receive messages.
Application developers SHOULD use it to access capabilities for peer discovery, message routing, and peer-to-peer reliability.

## Motivation

The accessibility of Logos Messaging protocols is capped by the accessibility of their implementations, and hence API.
This RFC enables a concerted effort to draft an API that is simple and accessible, and provides an opinion on sane defaults.

The API defined in this document is an opinionated-by-purpose method to use the more agnostic [WAKU2](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/10/waku2.html) protocols.

## Syntax

The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, 
“RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## API design

### IDL

A custom Interface Definition Language (IDL) in YAML is used to define the Messaging API.
Existing IDL Such as OpenAPI, AsyncAPI or WIT do not exactly fit the requirements for this API.
Hence, instead of having the reader learn a new IDL, we propose to use a simple IDL with self-describing syntax.

An alternative would be to choose a programming language. However, such choice may express unintended opinions on the API.

### Primitive types and general guidelines

- No `default` means that the value is mandatory, meaning a `default` value implies an optional parameter.
- Primitive types are `string`, `int`, `bool`, `byte`, `enum` and `uint`
- Complex pre-defined types are:
  - `object`: object and other nested types.
  - `array`: iterable object containing values of all the same type. Syntax: `array<T>` where `T` is the element type (e.g., `array<string>`, `array<byte>`).
  - `result`: an enum type that either contains a value or void (success), or an error (failure); The error is left to the implementor.
  - `error`: Left to the implementor on whether `error` types are `string` or `object` in the given language.
  - `event_emitter`: an object that emits events with specific event names and associated event data types.
- Usage of `result` is RECOMMENDED, usage of exceptions is NOT RECOMMENDED, no matter the language.

TODO: Review whether to specify categories of errors.

### Language mappings

How the API definition should be translated to specific languages.

```yaml
language_mappings:
  typescript:
    naming_convention:
      - functions: "camelCase"
      - variables: "camelCase"
      - types: "PascalCase"
    event_emitter: "Use EventEmitter object with `emit`, `addListener`, etc; with event name the string specified in IDL. For example. eventEmitter.emit('message_sent',...)"
  nim:
    naming_convention:
      - functions: "camelCase"
      - variables: "camelCase"
      - types: "PascalCase"
    event_emitter: TBD
```

### Application

This API is designed for generic use and ease across all programming languages, for `edge` and `core` type nodes.

## The Messaging API

```yaml
api_version: "0.0.1"
library_name: "liblogosdelivery"
description: "Logos Messaging: a private and censorship-resistant message routing library."
```

### Common

This section describes common types used throughout the API.

Note that all types in the API are described once in this document, in a single section. Types should just forward-reference other types when needed.

#### Init node extended definitions

**`mode`**:

If the `mode` set is `edge`, the initialised `WakuNode` SHOULD use:

- [LIGHTPUSH](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/19/lightpush.html) as client
- [FILTER](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/12/filter.html) as client
- [STORE](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/13/store.html) as client
- [METADATA](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/66/metadata.html) as client
- [PEER-EXCHANGE](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/34/peer-exchange.html) as client
- [P2P-RELIABILITY](/standards/application/p2p-reliability.md)

If the `mode` set is `core`, the initialised `WakuNode` SHOULD use:

- [RELAY](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/stable/11/relay.html)
- [LIGHTPUSH](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/19/lightpush.html) as service node
- [FILTER](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/12/filter.html) as service node
- [STORE](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/13/store.html) as client
- [METADATA](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/66/metadata.html) as client and service node
- [P2P-RELIABILITY](/standards/application/p2p-reliability.md)
- [DISCV5](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/33/discv5.html)
- [PEER-EXCHANGE](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/34/peer-exchange.html) as client and service node
- [RENDEZVOUS](https://github.com/logos-co/logos-lips/blob/master/docs/messaging/raw/rendezvous.md) as client and service node

`edge` mode SHOULD be used if node functions in resource restricted environment,
whereas `core` SHOULD be used if node has no strong hardware or bandwidth restrictions.

#### Messaging type definitions

```yaml
types:

  MessageEnvelope:
    type: object
    fields:

    fields:
      request_id:
        type: RequestId
        description: "The request ID associated with the propagated message in the network"

      "message_error":
        type: MessageErrorEvent
      "message_propagated":
        type: MessagePropagatedEvent
```

#### Messaging function definitions

```yaml
functions:

  send:
    description: "Send a message through the network."
    parameters:
      - name: message
        type: MessageEnvelope
        description: "Parameters for sending the message."
    returns:
      type: result<RequestId, error>
```

#### Messaging extended definitions

A first `message` sent with a certain `contentTopic` SHOULD trigger a subscription for such `contentTopic` as described in the `Subscriptions` section.

The node uses [P2P-RELIABILITY](/standards/application/p2p-reliability.md) strategies to ensure message delivery.

### Subscriptions

#### Subscriptions type definitions

```yaml
types:

  SubscriptionError:
    type: object
    description: "A content topic subscription-related operation failed synchronously and irremediably"
    fields:
      content-topic:
        type: string
        description: "Content topic that the node failed to subscribe to or unsubscribe from"
      error:
        type: string
        description: "Error message describing what went wrong"
```

#### Subscriptions function definitions

```yaml
functions:

  subscribe:
    description: "Subscribe to specific content topics"
    parameters:
      - name: contentTopics
        type: Array<string>
        description: "The content topics for the node to subscribe to."
    returns:
        type: result<void, array<SubscriptionError>>

  unsubscribe:
    description: "Unsubscribe from specific content topics"
    parameters:
      - name: contentTopics
        type: Array<ContentTopic>
        description: "The content topics for the node to unsubscribe from."
    returns:
        type: result<void, array<SubscriptionError>>
```

#### Subscriptions extended definitions

**`mode`**:

If the `mode` set is `edge`, `subscribe` SHOULD trigger set up a subscription using [FILTER](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/12/filter.html) as client and [P2P-RELIABILITY](/standards/application/p2p-reliability.md).

If the `mode` set is `core`, `subscribe` SHOULD trigger set up a subscription using [RELAY](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/stable/11/relay.html) and [P2P-RELIABILITY](/standards/application/p2p-reliability.md).
This MAY trigger joining a new shard if not already set.

Only messages on subscribed content topics SHOULD be emitted by a `MessageEvents` event source, meaning messages received via `RELAY` SHOULD be filtered by content topics before emission.

**`error`**:

Only irremediable failures should lead to synchronously returning a subscription error for failed subscribe or unsubscribe operations.

Failure to reach nodes can be omitted, and should be handled via the health events;
[P2P-RELIABILITY](/standards/application/p2p-reliability.md) SHOULD handle automated re-subscriptions and redundancy.

Examples of irremediable failures are:

- Invalid content topic format
- Exceeding number of content topics
- Node not started
- Already unsubscribed
- Other node-level configuration issue

### Health

#### Health type definitions

```yml
types:

  ConnectionStatus:
    type: enum
    values: [Disconnected, PartiallyConnected, Connected]
    description: "Used to identify health of the operating node"

        type: EventContentTopicHealthChange
      "shard_topic_health_change":
        type: EventShardTopicHealthChange
```

#### Health function definitions

TODO

#### Health extended definitions

**`EventConnectionStatusChange`**:

`Disconnected` indicates that the node has lost connectivity for message reception,
sending, or both, and as a result, it cannot reliably receive or transmit messages.

`PartiallyConnected` indicates that the node meets the minimum operational requirements:
it is connected to at least one peer with a protocol to send messages ([LIGHTPUSH](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/19/lightpush.html) or [RELAY](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/stable/11/relay.html)),
one peer with a protocol to receive messages ([FILTER](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/12/filter.html) or [RELAY](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/stable/11/relay.html)),
and one peer with [STORE](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/13/store.html) service capabilities,
although performance or reliability may still be impacted.

`Connected` indicates that the node is operating optimally,
with full support for message reception and transmission.

**`EventContentTopicHealthChange`** and **`EventShardTopicHealthChange`**:

`NOT_SUBSCRIBED` indicates that the node is not subscribed to the topic.

`UNHEALTHY` indicates that the node has no peers on the topic.

`MINIMALLY_HEALTHY` indicates that the node has at least one peer on the topic but has not reached the healthy threshold.

`SUFFICIENTLY_HEALTHY` indicates that the node has reached the healthy threshold of peers on the topic.

### Debug

#### Debug function definitions

```yaml
functions:
  getAvailableNodeInfoIds:
    description: "Returns a list of available node information identifiers. e.g., [ version, my_peer_id, metrics ]."
    returns:
      type: result<array<string>, error>

  getNodeInfo:
    description: "Returns the JSON formatted node's information that is requested. Expect single value or list results depending on requested information."
    parameters:
      - name: nodeInfoId
        type: string
        description: "Information identifier. The only supported values are the ones returned by getAvailableNodeInfoItems function."
    returns:
      type: result<string, error>

  getAvailableConfigs:
    description: "Returns a list of all available options, their description and default values."
    returns:
      type: string
```

## The Validation API

[WAKU2-RLN-RELAY](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/17/rln-relay.html) is currently the primary message validation mechanism in place.

Work is scheduled to specify a validate API to enable plug-in validation.
As part of this API, it will be expected that a validation object can be passed,
that would contain all validation parameters including RLN.

In the time being, parameters specific to RLN are accepted for the message validation.

## Abstract

This document specifies the **Reliable Channel API**,
an application-level interface that sits between the application layer and the [MESSAGING-API](messaging-api.md) plus [P2P-RELIABILITY](p2p-reliability.md), i.e., `application` <-> **reliable-channel-api** <-> `messaging-api/p2p-reliability`.

It bundles segmentation, end-to-end reliability via [Scalable Data Sync (SDS)](https://lip.logos.co/anoncomms/raw/sds.html), rate limit management, and a pluggable encryption hook
into a single interface for sending and receiving messages reliably.

## Motivation

The [MESSAGING-API](messaging-api.md) provides peer-to-peer reliability via [P2P-RELIABILITY](p2p-reliability.md),
but does not provide high end-to-end delivery guarantees from sender to recipient.

This API addresses that gap by introducing:
- **[SEGMENTATION](./segmentation.md)** to handle large messages exceeding network size limits.
- **[SDS](https://lip.logos.co/anoncomms/raw/sds.html)** to provide causal-history-based end-to-end acknowledgement and retransmission.
- **Rate Limit Manager** to comply with [RLN](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/17/rln-relay.html) constraints when sending segmented messages.
- **Encryption Hook** to allow upper layers to provide a pluggable encryption mechanism. This enables applications to provide Confidentiality and Integrity if desired. 

The separation between Reliable Channels and encryption ensures the API remains agnostic to identity and key management concerns,
which are handled by higher layers.

## Syntax

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## API design

### Architectural position

The Reliable Channel API sits between the application layer and the Messaging API, as follows:

```

### IDL

A custom Interface Definition Language (IDL) in YAML is used, consistent with [MESSAGING-API](messaging-api.md).

## Components

### Segmentation

A protocol that splits message payloads into smaller units during transmission and reassembles them upon reception. The component is instantiated by supplying the appropriate value to SegmentationConfig.

See [SEGMENTATION](./segmentation.md).

### Scalable Data Sync (SDS)

[SDS](https://lip.logos.co/anoncomms/raw/sds.html) provides end-to-end delivery guarantees using causal history tracking.

- Each new segment to be sent, requires the following data:
  - `MessageId`: a keccak-256([message](https://lip.logos.co/anoncomms/raw/sds.html#message)'s content) hex string (e.g. `4e03657aea45a94fc7d47ba826c8d667c0d1e6e33a64a036ec44f58fa12d6c45`), generated by the Reliable Channel API.
  - `ChannelId`: the `channelId` passed to `createReliableChannel`.
  - `Retrieval hint`: the transport `MessageHash` of previous segments, mentioned as `message_hash` in [MESSAGING-API](messaging-api.md), upon ``MessageSendPropagatedEvent` reception.
  The hint provider registered during [Node initialization](#node-initialization) performs this `MessageId → MessageHash` lookup. In turn, that mapping MUST be persisted by SDS using the `persistence` backend configured in `SdsConfig`.

- Each sent segment is added to an outgoing buffer.
- The recipient sends acknowledgements back to the sender upon receiving segments.
- The sender removes acknowledged segments from the outgoing buffer.
- Unacknowledged segments are retransmitted after `acknowledgementTimeoutMs`.
- SDS state MUST be persisted using the `persistence` backend configured in `SdsConfig`.

### Rate Limit Manager

The Rate Limit Manager ensures compliance with [RLN](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/17/rln-relay.html) rate constraints.

- It tracks how many messages have been sent in the current epoch.
- When the limit is approached, segment dispatch MUST be delayed to the next epoch.
- The epoch size MUST match the `[epochPeriodSec](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/17/rln-relay.html#epoch-length)` configured in `RateLimitConfig`.

### Encryption Hook

The Encryption Hook provides a pluggable interface for upper layers to inject encryption.

- The hook is optional; when not provided, messages are sent unencrypted.
- Encryption is applied per segment, after segmentation and SDS.
- Decryption is applied per segment before being processed by SDS.
- The `Encryption` interface MUST be implemented by the caller when the hook is provided.
- The Reliable Channel API MUST NOT impose any specific encryption scheme.

### Wire Format

This section defines the on-the-wire identity of a Reliable Channel segment.

#### Spec Marker

A short, fixed, unencrypted tag that identifies a message on the wire as belonging to
this layer. The marker value is the ASCII string:

```
RELIABLE-CHANNEL-API/1
```

- The marker MUST be attached to every outgoing segment **outside** the encrypted payload,
  so that receivers can evaluate it without performing decryption.
- On reception, segments whose marker is absent or does not equal the value above MUST be
  silently dropped, before any decryption or SDS processing is attempted.
- The marker is an integrity hint, not an authenticator: it is trivially spoofable and
  carries no cryptographic guarantees. See [Security/Privacy Considerations](#securityprivacy-considerations).

#### Versioning

The trailing `/N` is the **wire-format version** of this layer. It is intentionally
decoupled from this spec's slug and from its lifecycle status (`raw`, `draft`,
`stable`, …), so that editorial changes to the document do not invalidate deployed
implementations.

- The wire-format version MUST be bumped (`/1` → `/2`) **only** when an editor of this
  spec declares a change that breaks on-the-wire compatibility — for example, a new
  marker placement, a change to segment framing, or a non-additive change to required
  fields.
- Editorial changes (typos, link fixes, clarifications, timeline regeneration,
  contributor updates) MUST NOT bump the wire-format version.
- Implementations MUST pin the exact version they support and reject segments carrying
  a different version, rather than attempting best-effort compatibility.
- A bump MUST be recorded in this section together with a one-line rationale, so the
  history of wire-format changes is readable independently of git.

## Procedures

### Node initialization

When a node is created via `createNode` (defined in [MESSAGING-API](messaging-api.md)),
the implementation MUST perform the following setup before the node is used:

1. **Configure SDS persistence**: Supply the `Persistence` backend from `SdsConfig` to the SDS module so that
   causal history and outgoing buffers survive restarts.
2. **Configure SDS hint provider**: Register a hint provider with the SDS module.
   The hint provider converts an SDS `MessageId` into its corresponding `MessageHash`.
3. **Configure Segmentation persistence**: Supply the `Persistence` backend from `SegmentationConfig` to the
   [Segmentation](./segmentation.md) module so that partially reassembled messages survive restarts.
4. **Fetch missed messages**: Retrieve messages missed while offline as described in
   [MESSAGING-API — Fetching missed messages on startup](messaging-api.md#init-node-extended-definitions).

### Outgoing message processing

When `send` is called, the implementation MUST process `message` in the following order:

1. **Segment**: Split the payload into segments as defined in [SEGMENTATION](./segmentation.md).
2. **Apply [SDS](https://lip.logos.co/anoncomms/raw/sds.html)**: add each sds message to the SDS outgoing buffer (see [SDS](#scalable-data-sync-sds) for parameter bindings).
3. **Encrypt**: If an `Encryption` implementation is provided, encrypt each segment before transmission.
4. **Tag with spec marker**: Attach the [Spec Marker](#spec-marker) (`RELIABLE-CHANNEL-API/1`) to the segment, outside the encrypted payload.
5. **Rate Limit**: If `RateLimitConfig.enabled` is `true`, delay dispatch as needed to comply with [RLN](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/17/rln-relay.html) epoch constraints.
6. **Dispatch**: Send each segment via the underlying [MESSAGING-API](messaging-api.md).

### Incoming message processing

When a segment is received from the network, the implementation MUST process it in the following order:

1. **Validate spec marker**: Check that the segment carries the [Spec Marker](#spec-marker) (`RELIABLE-CHANNEL-API/1`). Segments whose marker is missing or does not match MUST be silently dropped, with no further processing.
2. **Decrypt**: If an `Encryption` implementation is provided, decrypt the segment.
3. **Apply [SDS](https://lip.logos.co/anoncomms/raw/sds.html)**: Deliver the segment to the SDS layer, which emits acknowledgements and detects gaps.
   - **Detect missing dependencies**: If SDS detects a gap in the causal history, it MUST make a best-effort attempt to retrieve the missing message. The `Retrieval hint` (see [Scalable Data Sync (SDS)](#scalable-data-sync-sds)) carried in each SDS message provides the transport `MessageHash` needed to query the store; without it, store retrieval is not possible. If the message cannot be retrieved, SDS MAY mark it as lost.
4. **Reassemble**: Once all segments for a message have been received, reassemble and emit a `reliable:message:received` event.

### Rate limiting

When `RateLimitConfig.enabled` is `true`, the implementation MUST space segment transmissions
to comply with the [RLN](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/17/rln-relay.html) epoch constraints defined in `[epochPeriodSec](https://lip.logos.co/messaging/draft/17/rln-relay.html#epoch-length)`.
Segments MUST NOT be sent at a rate that would violate the RLN message rate limit for the active epoch.

### Encryption

The `encryption` parameter in `createReliableChannel` is intentionally optional.
The Reliable Channel API is agnostic to encryption mechanisms.

When an `Encryption` implementation is provided, it MUST be applied as described in [Outgoing message processing](#outgoing-message-processing) and [Incoming message processing](#incoming-message-processing).

## The Reliable Channel API

This API considers the types defined by [MESSAGING-API](messaging-api.md) plus the following.

### Channel lifecycle

This point assumes that a WakuNode instance is created beforehand. See `createNode` function
in [MESSAGING-API](/standards/application/messaging-api.md).

```yaml
functions:

  createReliableChannel:
    description: "Creates a reliable channel over the given content topic. Sets up the required SDS state,
    segmentation, and encryption, and subscribes to `contentTopic`."
    parameters:
      - name: node
        type: WakuNode
        description: "The underlying messaging node, as defined in [MESSAGING-API](messaging-api.md).
        Used to send segments and to subscribe/unsubscribe to the content topics."
      - name: channelId
        type: string
        description: "Unique identifier for this channel. Represents the reliable (SDS), segmented, and optionally-encrypted session."
      - name: contentTopic
        type: string
        description: "The topic this channel listens and sends on. This has routing and filtering connotations."
      - name: senderId
        type: string
        description: "An identifier for this sender. SHOULD be unique and persisted between sessions."
      - name: encryption
        type: optional<Encryption>
        default: none
        description: "Optional pluggable encryption implementation. If none, messages are sent unencrypted."
    returns:
      type: result<ReliableChannel, error>

  closeChannel:
    description: "Closes a reliable channel, releases all associated resources and internal state,
    and unsubscribes from its content topic via the underlying [MESSAGING-API](messaging-api.md)."
    parameters:
      - name: channel
        type: ReliableChannel
        description: "The channel handle returned by `createReliableChannel`."
    returns:
      type: result<void, error>
```

### Channel usage

```yaml
functions:
  send:
    description: "Send a message through a reliable channel. The message is always segmented,
    SDS-tracked, rate-limited (optional), and encrypted (optional)."
    parameters:
      - name: channel
        type: ReliableChannel
        description: "The channel handle returned by `createReliableChannel`."
      - name: message
        type: array<byte>
        description: "The raw message payload to send."
    returns:
      type: result<RequestId, error>
      description: "Returns a `RequestId` that callers can use to correlate subsequent `MessageSentEvent` or `MessageSendErrorEvent` events."
```

### Node configuration

This spec extends `NodeConfig`, needed to create a node, which is 
defined in [MESSAGING-API](messaging-api.md), 
with `sds_config` and `rate_limit_config` fields.

```yaml
NodeConfig:  # Extends NodeConfig defined in MESSAGING-API
  fields:
    sds_config:
      type: SdsConfig
      description: "SDS configuration. See SdsConfig defined in this spec."
    rate_limit_config:
      type: RateLimitConfig
      description: "See RateLimitConfig defined in this spec."
    segmentation_config:
      type: SegmentationConfig
      description: "See SegmentationConfig defined in this spec."

```

### Type definitions

```yaml
types:

  ReliableChannel:
    type: object
    description: "A handle representing an open reliable channel.
    Returned by `createReliableChannel` and used to send messages and receive events.
    Internal state (SDS, segmentation, encryption) is managed by the implementation."
    events:
      "reliable:message:received":
        type: MessageReceivedEvent
      "reliable:message:sent":
        type: MessageSentEvent
      "reliable:message:delivered":
        type: MessageDeliveredEvent
      "reliable:message:send-error":
        type: MessageSendErrorEvent

    fields:
      message:
        type: array<byte>
        description: "The reassembled message payload."

  MessageSentEvent:
    type: object
    description: "Event emitted when all segments of a message have been transmitted to the network.
    This confirms network-level dispatch only; it does not guarantee the recipient has processed the message.
    For end-to-end confirmation, listen for `MessageDeliveredEvent`."
    fields:
      requestId:
        type: RequestId
        description: "The identifier of the `send` operation whose segments have all been dispatched to the network."

  MessageDeliveredEvent:
    type: object
    description: "Event emitted when the recipient has confirmed end-to-end receipt of a message via SDS acknowledgements.
    This event is fired asynchronously after `MessageSentEvent`, once the SDS layer receives explicit acknowledgements from the recipient."
    fields:
      requestId:
        type: RequestId
        description: "The identifier of the `send` operation confirmed as delivered by the recipient."

  MessageSendErrorEvent:
    type: object
    description: "Event emitted when one or more segments of a message could not be dispatched to the network.
    This indicates a network-level failure; the message was never fully transmitted."
    fields:
      requestId:
        type: RequestId
        description: "The identifier of the `send` operation that failed to dispatch."
      error:
        type: string
        description: "Human-readable description of the dispatch failure."

  MessageDeliveryErrorEvent:
    type: object
    description: "Event emitted when end-to-end delivery could not be confirmed.
    The message reached the network and there's no need to explicit re-send.
    Fired after `maxRetransmissions` attempts have been exhausted without receiving an SDS acknowledgement from the recipient."
    fields:
      requestId:
        type: RequestId
        description: "The identifier of the `send` operation that was not acknowledged by the recipient."
      error:
        type: string
        description: "Human-readable description of the delivery failure."

  RequestId:
    type: string
    description: "Unique identifier for a single `send` operation on a reliable channel.
    It groups all segments produced by segmenting one message, so callers can correlate
    acknowledgement and error events back to the original send call.
    Internally, each segment is dispatched as an independent [MESSAGING-API](messaging-api.md) call,
    producing one `RequestId` (as defined in [MESSAGING-API](messaging-api.md)) per segment.
    A single `RequestId` therefore maps to one or more underlying [MESSAGING-API](messaging-api.md)'s `RequestId` values,
    one per segment sent.
    For example, the `RequestId` `Req_a` yields these MESSAGING-API requests:
    `Req_a:1`, `Req_a:2`, ..., `Req_a:N`, where `Req_a:k` represents the k-th
    MESSAGING-API segment `RequestId`.
    That is, `Req_a` is the `RequestId` from the RELIABLE-CHANNEL-API spec PoV,
    whereas `Req_a:k` is the `RequestId` from the MESSAGING-API spec PoV.

```

## Security/Privacy Considerations

- This API does not provide confidentiality by default. An `Encryption` implementation MUST be supplied when confidentiality is required.
- Segment metadata (message ID, segment index, total segments) is visible to network observers unless encrypted by the hook.
- SDS acknowledgement messages are sent over the same content topic and are subject to the same confidentiality concerns.
- Rate limiting compliance is required to avoid exclusion from the network by RLN-enforcing relays.
- The [Spec Marker](#spec-marker) is unencrypted and identifies traffic as belonging to this layer to any on-path observer. It is not authenticated: an attacker can forge the marker on arbitrary payloads, so receivers MUST treat marker presence only as a coarse pre-filter and rely on decryption and SDS to detect malformed or unsolicited messages.

## Abstract

This specification defines the encoding format for Introduction Bundles — the
out-of-band information shared so that a remote party can initiate contact with
the bundle publisher.

## Background / Rationale / Motivation

Users need a way to share contact information across arbitrary channels
(messaging apps, emails, QR codes, URLs, CLI terminals) without relying on a
centralized directory. The Introduction Bundle provides the cryptographic
material required to establish an encrypted conversation.

The encoding must be:
- Copy-paste safe across arbitrary text transports.
- Space-efficient for manual sharing.
- Version-aware to support protocol evolution.

## Theory / Semantics

An Introduction Bundle is bound to a specific protocol version; its encoded
form identifies the version unambiguously.

### Why ASCII, Not Unicode

The encoded string consists entirely of printable ASCII. This is a natural
consequence of the design rather than a defensive choice against Unicode:

1. **No human-readable content.** The format contains a fixed prefix, a numeric
   version, and a binary-to-text encoded payload. These components do not
   require characters outside ASCII. Common binary-to-text encodings such as
   hex, base32, and base64 produce ASCII output.
2. **Encoding stability.** Printable ASCII characters are represented
   identically in widely deployed text encodings such as UTF-8 and Latin-1,
   avoiding ambiguity in character interpretation across transports.
3. **Restricted visible alphabet.** Limiting the character set reduces the risk
   of visually confusable or non-rendering characters during manual comparison,
   transcription, or copy-paste across different platforms, terminals, and
   fonts.

### Delimiter Choice

The `_` character is present in the alphabets of common binary-to-text
encodings (hex, base32, base64url) and may therefore appear inside the payload.
Parsers MUST split the encoded string on the **first three** `_` characters;
everything after the third `_` is the payload verbatim.

The underscore was chosen because it is a printable ASCII character that is
safe in URLs, filenames, and plain text without requiring escaping. Delimiters
outside this category (e.g., `.` or `:`) may require percent-encoding in
certain URL contexts, undermining the transport-safety goal.

## Wire Format Specification / Syntax

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

### Text Format

The Introduction Bundle is encoded as a single ASCII string:

```
logos_<namespace>_<version>_<payload>
```

| Field       | Description                                                       |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `logos`     | Fixed prefix. Identifies the string as a Logos protocol artifact. |
| `namespace` | Domain identifier. Distinguishes bundle types.                    |
| `version`   | Protocol version number. Decimal integer, no leading zeros.       |
| `payload`   | Binary-to-text encoded payload (version-specific).                |

Fields are separated by `_` (underscore).

### V1

#### Parameters

| Parameter   | Value                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| `namespace` | `chatintro`                    |
| `version`   | `1`                            |
| `encoding`  | base64url, no padding          |
| `payload`   | Protobuf-encoded `IntroBundle` |

#### Payload Encoding

V1 uses **base64url without padding** ([RFC 4648 §5], padding
characters `=` omitted). This encoding was chosen for:

- URL safety without percent-encoding.
- ~33% size overhead (compared to ~100% for hex).
- Wide library support across languages.

Future versions MAY choose a different binary-to-text encoding.

#### Binary Payload

The payload is a Protocol Buffers (proto3) encoding of:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

message IntroBundle {
  bytes installation_pubkey = 1;  // 32 bytes, X25519
  bytes ephemeral_pubkey    = 2;  // 32 bytes, X25519
  bytes signature           = 3;  // 64 bytes, XEdDSA
}
```

The encoding MUST use standard proto3 serialization. Canonical (deterministic)
serialization is NOT REQUIRED; decoders MUST accept any valid proto3 encoding
of the message.

#### Encoding Procedure

1. Construct the `IntroBundle` protobuf message.
2. Serialize using proto3 encoding (~134 bytes).
3. Encode as base64url without padding (~179 characters).
4. Prepend the preamble with version prefix.

The resulting string is ~197 printable ASCII characters.

## Security/Privacy Considerations

The signature prevents tampering but does not provide confidentiality. Bundles
should be transmitted over channels appropriate for the user's threat model.

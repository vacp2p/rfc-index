## Abstract

This specification establishes a common vocabulary and standardized definitions for terms used across chat protocol specifications. It serves as a normative reference to ensure consistent interpretation of terminology across application level specifications.

## Background / Rationale / Motivation

Chat protocol specifications often employ similar terminology with subtle but important semantic differences. The absence of standardized definitions leads to ambiguity in specification interpretation and implementation inconsistencies across different protocol variants.

Establishing a shared definitions document provides several benefits:

1. **Semantic Consistency**: Ensures uniform interpretation of common terms across multiple specifications
2. **Implementation Clarity**: Reduces ambiguity for protocol implementers
3. **Specification Quality**: Enables more precise and concise specification language through reference to established definitions
4. **Ecosystem Coherence**: Promotes consistent understanding within the chat protocol ecosystem.

This specification provides normative definitions that other chat protocol specifications MAY reference to establish precise semantic meaning for common terminology.

## Theory / Semantics

### Definition Categories

Terms are organized into the following categories for clarity and ease of reference:

- **Roles**: Defined entity types that determine how a participant behaves within a communication protocol.
- **Message Types**: Classifications and categories of protocol messages
- **Transports**: Abstract methods of transmitting payloads
-**Software Entities**: Distinct software-defined actors or components that participate in the operation of chat protocols.

## Definitions

### Roles

**Sender**: A client which is pushing a payload on to the network, to one or more recipients.

**Recipient**: A client which is the intended receiver of a payload. In a group context there maybe multiple recipients 

**Participant**: A generic term for the rightful members of a conversation. Senders and Recipients are roles that participants can hold.

### Message Types

The term "message" often has multiple meanings depending on context. The following definitions are used to disambiguate between different abstraction levels. 

**Content**: An opaque byte sequence whose meaning is defined solely by the Application. The chat protocol layer neither interprets nor validates Content structure.

**Frame**: A structured protocol message exchanged between Clients. Frames are typed data structures that carry protocol meaning — they are how clients coordinate state and exchange information. Some Frames may carry Content as an opaque field. Once serialized for transport they become Payloads.

**Payload**: The serialized binary representation of a Frame, treated by the transport layer as an opaque byte sequence with no chat-layer semantics.


Other specific message types include:

**Content Type**: A definition of the structure and encoding of a Content instance, interpreted solely by the Application.

**Delivery Acknowledgement**: A notification from a receiving client to sender that their message was successfully received. While similar to a read-receipt, delivery acknowledgements differ in that the acknowledgement originates based on the client, where read-receipts are fired when they are displayed to a user.

**Invite**: A frame used to initialize a new conversation. Invites notify a client that someone wants to communicate with them, and provides the required information to do so.


### Transports

**Out-of-Band**: The transfer of information using a channel separate from the defined chat protocol. Data sent Out-of-Band is transmitted using an undefined mechanism. This is used when protocols requires information to be shared with another entity, but it does not describe how that should occur. The responsibility to define how this occurs is the implementer or other protocols in the suite. 


### Software Entities

**Client**: A software component that manages Conversations and exposes messaging capabilities to Applications. The Client acts as the interface between the Application and the underlying protocol.

**Application**: Software that integrates with a Client in order to send and receive content. Applications are responsible for displaying content and controlling what content gets sent.

**Conversation**: An instance of a chat protocol between a set of participants. Conversations are responsible for protocol operations including encryption, key management, and frame generation.


## Wire Format Specification / Syntax

This specification does not define wire format elements. All definitions are semantic and apply to the interpretation of terms used in other specifications that do define wire formats.

## Security/Privacy Considerations

This specification defines terminology only and does not introduce security or privacy considerations beyond those present in specifications that reference these definitions.

The definitions provided in this specification do not alter the security or privacy properties of implementations that adopt the defined terminology.

## Abstract

This specification describes how Waku provides confidentiality, authenticity, and
integrity, as well as some form of unlinkability.
Specifically, it describes how encryption, decryption and
signing works in [6/WAKU1](../../legacy/6/waku1.md) and
in [10/WAKU2](../../core/10/waku2.md) with [14/WAKU-MESSAGE](../../core/14/message.md#version1).

This specification effectively replaces [7/WAKU-DATA](../../legacy/7/data.md)
as well as [6/WAKU1 Payload encryption](../../legacy/6/waku1.md#payload-encryption)
but written in a way that is agnostic and self-contained for [6/WAKU1](../../legacy/6/waku1.md) and [10/WAKU2](../../core/10/waku2.md).

Large sections of the specification originate from
[EIP-627: Whisper spec](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-627) as well from
[RLPx Transport Protocol spec (ECIES encryption)](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/rlpx.md#ecies-encryption)
with some modifications.

## Specification

The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and
“OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

For [6/WAKU1](../../legacy/6/waku1.md),
the `data` field is used in the [waku envelope](../../legacy/6/waku1.md#abnf-specification)
and the field MAY contain the encrypted payload.

For [10/WAKU2](../../core/10/waku2.md),
the `payload` field is used in `WakuMessage`
and MAY contain the encrypted payload.

The fields that are concatenated and
encrypted as part of the `data` (Waku legacy) or
`payload` (Waku) field are:

- `flags`
- `payload-length`
- `payload`
- `padding`
- `signature`

## Design requirements

- *Confidentiality*:
The adversary SHOULD NOT be able to learn what data is being sent from one Waku node
to one or several other Waku nodes.
- *Authenticity*:
The adversary SHOULD NOT be able to cause Waku endpoint
to accept data from any third party as though it came from the other endpoint.
- *Integrity*:
The adversary SHOULD NOT be able to cause a Waku endpoint to
accept data that has been tampered with.

Notable, *forward secrecy* is not provided for at this layer.
If this property is desired,
a more fully featured secure communication protocol can be used on top.

It also provides some form of *unlinkability* since:

- only participants who are able to decrypt a message can see its signature
- payload are padded to a fixed length

## Cryptographic primitives

- AES-256-GCM (for symmetric encryption)
- ECIES
- ECDSA
- KECCAK-256

ECIES is using the following cryptosystem:

- Curve: secp256k1
- KDF: NIST SP 800-56 Concatenation Key Derivation Function, with SHA-256 option
- MAC: HMAC with SHA-256
- AES: AES-128-CTR

### ABNF

Using [Augmented Backus-Naur form (ABNF)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234)
we have the following format:

```abnf
; 1 byte; first two bits contain the size of payload-length field,
; third bit indicates whether the signature is present.
flags           = 1OCTET

; contains the size of payload.
payload-length  = 4*OCTET

; byte array of arbitrary size (may be zero).
payload         = *OCTET

; byte array of arbitrary size (may be zero).
padding         = *OCTET

; 65 bytes, if present.
signature       = 65OCTET

data            = flags payload-length payload padding [signature]

; This field is called payload in Waku
payload         = data
```

### Signature

Those unable to decrypt the payload/data are also unable to access the signature.
The signature, if provided,
SHOULD be the ECDSA signature of the Keccak-256 hash of the unencrypted data
using the secret key of the originator identity.
The signature is serialized as the concatenation of the `r`, `s` and `v` parameters
of the SECP-256k1 ECDSA signature, in that order.
`r` and `s` MUST be big-endian encoded, fixed-width 256-bit unsigned.
`v` MUST be an 8-bit big-endian encoded,
non-normalized and should be either 27 or 28.

See [Ethereum "Yellow paper": Appendix F Signing transactions](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf)
for more information on signature generation, parameters and public key recovery.

### Encryption

#### Symmetric

Symmetric encryption uses AES-256-GCM for
[authenticated encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption).
The output of encryption is of the form (`ciphertext`, `tag`, `iv`)
where `ciphertext` is the encrypted message,
`tag` is a 16 byte message authentication tag and
`iv` is a 12 byte initialization vector (nonce).
The message authentication `tag` and
initialization vector `iv` field MUST be appended to the resulting `ciphertext`,
in that order.
Note that previous specifications and
some implementations might refer to `iv` as `nonce` or `salt`.

#### Asymmetric

Asymmetric encryption uses the standard Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme
(ECIES) with SECP-256k1 public key.

#### ECIES

This section originates from the [RLPx Transport Protocol spec](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/rlpx.md#ecies-encryption)
specification with minor modifications.

The cryptosystem used is:

- The elliptic curve secp256k1 with generator `G`.
- `KDF(k, len)`: the NIST SP 800-56 Concatenation Key Derivation Function.
- `MAC(k, m)`: HMAC using the SHA-256 hash function.
- `AES(k, iv, m)`: the AES-128 encryption function in CTR mode.

Special notation used: `X || Y` denotes concatenation of `X` and `Y`.

Alice wants to send an encrypted message that can be decrypted by
Bob's static private key `kB`.
Alice knows about Bobs static public key `KB`.

To encrypt the message `m`, Alice generates a random number `r` and
corresponding elliptic curve public key `R = r * G` and
computes the shared secret `S = Px` where `(Px, Py) = r * KB`.
She derives key material for encryption and
authentication as `kE || kM = KDF(S, 32)`
as well as a random initialization vector `iv`.
Alice sends the encrypted message `R || iv || c || d` where `c = AES(kE, iv , m)`
and `d = MAC(sha256(kM), iv || c)` to Bob.

For Bob to decrypt the message `R || iv || c || d`,
he derives the shared secret `S = Px` where `(Px, Py) = kB * R`
as well as the encryption and authentication keys `kE || kM = KDF(S, 32)`.
Bob verifies the authenticity of the message
by checking whether `d == MAC(sha256(kM), iv || c)`
then obtains the plaintext as `m = AES(kE, iv || c)`.

### Padding

The `padding` field is used to align data size,
since data size alone might reveal important metainformation.
Padding can be arbitrary size.
However, it is recommended that the size of `data` field
(excluding the `iv` and `tag`) before encryption (i.e. plain text)
SHOULD be a multiple of 256 bytes.

### Decoding a message

In order to decode a message, a node SHOULD try to apply both symmetric and
asymmetric decryption operations.
This is because the type of encryption is not included in the message.

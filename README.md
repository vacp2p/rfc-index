# Logos LIP (RFC) Index

NOTE: This repo is still evolving while the LIP process is refined.

This repository contains specifications from the Messaging, Blockchain, Storage,
and IFT-TS components of the IFT portfolio. LIPs are Requests for Comments that
document protocols, processes, and system interfaces in a consistent, reviewable
format.

## LIP process

This repository replaces the old rfc.vac.dev resource. Specs are maintained in
Markdown here and progress through statuses such as raw, draft, stable, or
deprecated. The process and lifecycle are defined in:

- 1/COSS: `docs/ift-ts/raw/1/coss.md`

## Contributing

1. Open a pull request against this repo.
2. Add or update the LIP in the appropriate component folder.
3. Include status and category metadata in the header table.

If you are unsure where a document belongs, open an issue first and we will
help route it.

# Vac Request For Comments(RFC)

*NOTE*: This repo is WIP. We are currently restructuring the RFC process.

This repository contains specifications from the [Waku](https://waku.org/), [Nomos](https://nomos.tech/),
[Codex](https://codex.storage/), and
[Status](https://status.app/) projects that are part of the [IFT portfolio](https://free.technology/).
[Vac](https://vac.dev) is an
[IFT service](https://free.technology/services) that will manage the RFC,
[Request for Comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments),
process within this repository.

## New RFC Process

This repository replaces the previous `rfc.vac.dev` resource.
Each project will maintain initial specifications in separate repositories,
which may be considered as a **raw** specification.
All [Vac](https://vac.dev) **raw** specifications and
discussions will live in the Vac subdirectory.
When projects have reached some level of maturity
for a specification living in their repository,
the process of updating the status to **draft** may begin in this repository.
Specifications will adhere to
[1/COSS](./vac/1/coss.md) before obtaining **draft** status.

Implementations should follow specifications as described,
and all contributions will be discussed before the **stable** status is obtained.
The goal of this RFC process will to engage all interseted parities and
reach a rough consensus for techcinal specifications.

## Contributing

Please see [1/COSS](./vac/1/coss.md) for general guidelines and specification lifecycle.

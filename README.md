# Vac Request For Comments(RFC)

*NOTE*: This repo is WIP. We are currently restructuring the RFC process.

## RFC Process

This repository contains specifications from the [Vac](https://vac.dev), [Waku](https://waku.org/), [Nomos](https://nomos.tech/), [Codex](https://codex.storage/), and [Status](https://status.app/) software teams.
The goal of the RFC, [Request for Comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments),
process is to standardize techincal specification. 
This repository will track specifications that adhere to 1/COSS.
RFCs will be managed by the Vac team when specifcations have reached a rough consensus towards stabilization within each team.

Vac is an R&D org creating modular p2p protocols for private, secure, and censorship-resistant communication.
A detailed, albeit slightly outdated (2019), explanation of Vac and its design goals can be found [here](https://vac.dev/vac-overview).

Vac, while having a core team of maintainers and contributors, is an open and permission-less organization.

**See [rfc.vac.dev](https://rfc.vac.dev) for an easy to browse index of all RFCs.**

## Abstract

This RFC documents the performance and scalability considerations of the Logos Core Platform as specified in the current implementation. The current specifications focus on architectural design and do not provide explicit performance metrics, benchmarking methodology, or scaling considerations for large module deployments.

## Background / Rationale / Motivation

Performance and scalability are critical aspects of any modular platform architecture. Understanding the performance characteristics and scalability limitations helps in:

- **System Planning**: Designing applications within platform constraints
- **Architecture Decisions**: Making informed choices about module deployment
- **Performance Expectations**: Setting appropriate expectations for system behavior
- **Scaling Strategies**: Planning for growth and larger deployments

This RFC documents what is currently specified regarding performance and scalability in the Logos Core Platform.

## Current Performance Documentation Status

### Specifications Coverage

The current Logos Core Platform specifications focus primarily on:

- **Architectural Design**: Process-isolated modular architecture
- **API Definitions**: Core API functions and their purposes
- **Authentication System**: Token-based inter-module authentication
- **Module Interface**: Common interface requirements for modules

### Performance-Related Information

The specifications do not currently include:

- **Benchmarking Methodology**: No performance testing procedures are documented
- **Performance Metrics**: No specific performance measurements are provided
- **Scaling Considerations**: No explicit guidance for large module deployments
- **Performance Optimization**: No optimization strategies are documented
- **Bottleneck Analysis**: No identified performance bottlenecks are described

## Architectural Performance Implications

### Process Isolation Impact

The specifications document that:

> "Each module runs in its own process to improve robustness and security... This separation isolates faulty or untrusted modules and allows modules to be written in different languages"

The specifications note this architectural choice but do not discuss performance implications.

### Communication Architecture

The documented architecture includes:

- **RPC Mechanism**: Inter-module communication uses Remote Procedure Call system (as documented)
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Platform supports asynchronous method calls (as specified)
- **Authentication System**: Token-based authentication for inter-module calls (as documented)
- **Event System**: Event publishing and subscription capabilities (as specified)

## Implementation Status

### Current Focus

As noted in the specifications, this is a "living document" that may not fully reflect the ultimate design. The current implementation represents:

- **Proof-of-Concept Stage**: As noted in the specifications, this represents a proof-of-concept implementation
- **Living Document**: Specifications note this is a "living document" that may not fully reflect the ultimate design

### Performance Analysis Gap

The current specifications do not address:

- **Performance Testing Framework**: No testing methodology is documented
- **Benchmark Suite**: No standard benchmarks are defined
- **Scalability Limits**: No documented limits for module count or size
- **Resource Requirements**: No specified hardware or resource requirements
- **Performance Monitoring**: No monitoring or profiling capabilities are described

## Future Enhancement Areas

As noted in the specifications, this is a "living document" that may not fully reflect the ultimate design. Performance and scalability considerations are not currently documented in the specifications.

## Security/Privacy Considerations

### Architectural Considerations

The specifications document process isolation for security and robustness. Performance implications are not discussed in the current documentation.

## Implementation Considerations

### Platform Architecture

The specifications document:

- **Process Isolation**: Each module runs in its own process
- **Modular Design**: Platform supports modular architecture
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Platform provides asynchronous capabilities
- **Event System**: Platform includes event publishing and subscription

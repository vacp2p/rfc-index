## Abstract

This document specifies the Mantle layer of Bedrock,
the foundational execution layer that connects Nomos Services
to provide functionality for Sovereign Rollups.
Mantle serves as the system call interface of Bedrock,
exposing a safe and constrained set of Operations
to interact with lower-level Bedrock services,
similar to syscalls in an operating system.

## Introduction

Mantle is a foundational element of Bedrock,
designed to provide a minimal and efficient execution layer
that connects together Nomos Services
in order to provide the necessary functionality for Sovereign Rollups.
It can be viewed as the system call interface of Bedrock,
exposing a safe and constrained set of Operations
to interact with lower-level Bedrock services,
similar to syscalls in an operating system.

Mantle Transactions provide Operations for interacting with Nomos Services.
For example,
a Sovereign Rollup node posting an update to Bedrock,
or a node operator declaring its participation in the Blend Network,
would be done through the corresponding Operations within a Mantle Transaction.

Mantle manages assets using a Note-based blockchain ledger that follows an UTXO model.
Each Mantle Transaction includes a Ledger Transaction,
and any excess balance serves as the fee payment.

## Overview

### Transactions

The features of Nomos are exposed through Mantle Transactions.
Each transaction can contain zero or more [Operations](#operations)
and one [Ledger Transaction](#ledger-transactions).
Mantle Transactions enable users to execute multiple Operations atomically.
The Ledger Transaction serves two purposes,
it can pay the transaction fee and allows users to issue transfers.

### Operations

Nomos features are exposed through Mantle Operations,
which can be combined and executed together in a single Mantle Transaction.
These Operations enable functions such as on-chain data posting,
SDP interaction,
and leader reward claims.

### Ledger

The Mantle Ledger enables asset transfers using a transparent UTXO model.
While a Ledger Transaction can consume more NMO than it creates,
the Mantle Transaction excess balance must exactly pay for the fees.

### Fees

Mantle Transaction fees are derived from a gas model.
Nomos has three different Gas markets,
accounting for permanent data storage,
ephemeral data storage through DA,
and execution costs.
Permanent data storage is paid at the Mantle Transaction level,
while ephemeral data storage is paid at the Blob Operation level.
Each Operation and Ledger Transaction has an associated Execution Gas cost.
Users can specify their Gas prices in their Mantle Transactions
or in the Blob Operation to incentivize the network to include their transaction.

| Gas Market | Charged On | Pricing Basis |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Execution Gas | Ledger Transaction and Operations | Fixed per Operation |
| Permanent Storage Gas | Signed Mantle Transaction | Proportional to encoded size |
| DA Storage Gas | Blob Operation | Proportional to blob size |

## Mantle Transaction

Mantle Transactions form the core of Mantle,
enabling users to combine multiple Operations to access different Nomos functions.
Each transaction contains zero or more Operations plus a Ledger Transaction.
The system executes all Operations atomically,
while using the Mantle Transaction's excess balance
(calculated as the difference between consumed and created value) as the fee payment.

```python
class MantleTx:
    ops: list[Op]
    ledger_tx: LedgerTx  # excess balance is used for fee payment
    permanent_storage_gas_price: int  # 8 bytes
    execution_gas_price: int  # 8 bytes

class Op:
    opcode: byte
    payload: bytes

def mantle_txhash(tx: MantleTx) -> ZkHash:
    tx_bytes = encode(tx)
    h = Hasher()
    h.update(FiniteField(b"NOMOS_MANTLE_TXHASH_V1", byte_order="little", modulus=p))
    for i in range((len(tx_bytes)+30)//31):
        chunk = tx_bytes[i*31:(i+1)*31]
        fr = FiniteField(chunk, byte_order="little", modulus=p)
        h.update(fr)
    return h.digest()
```

The hash function used,
as well as other cryptographic primitives like ZK proofs and signature schemes,
are described in [NOMOS-COMMON-CRYPTOGRAPHIC-COMPONENTS][common-crypto].

A Mantle Transaction must include all relevant signatures and proofs
for each Operation,
as well as for the Ledger Transaction.

```python
class SignedMantleTx:
    tx: MantleTx
    op_proofs: list[OpProof | None]  # each Op has at most 1 associated proof
    ledger_tx_proof: ZkSignature  # ZK proof of ownership of the spent notes
```

Each proof (`op_proofs` and `ledger_tx_proof`) must be cryptographically bound
to the `MantleTx` through the `mantle_txhash` to prevent replay attacks.
This binding is achieved by including the `MantleTx` hash
as a public input in every ZK proof.

The transaction fee is a sum of two components:
the multiplication of the total Execution Gas by the `execution_gas_price`,
and the total size of the encoded signed Mantle Transaction
multiplied by the `permanent_storage_gas_price`.
If the Mantle Transaction contains Blob Operations,
the fee also accounts for ephemeral data storage.
In this case,
the `blob_size` of each blob is multiplied by the `DA_storage_gas_price`
stored in the Blob Operation
and added to the previous amounts to determine the final fee.

```python
def gas_fees(signed_tx: SignedMantleTx) -> int:
    mantle_tx = signed_tx.tx
    permanent_storage_fees = len(encode(signed_mantle_tx)) * mantle_tx.permanent_storage_gas_price
    execution_fees = execution_gas(mantle_tx.ledger_tx) * mantle_tx.execution_gas_price
    da_storage_fees = 0
    for op in mantle_tx.ops:
        if op.opcode == CHANNEL_BLOB:
            blob = decode_blob(op.payload)
            da_storage_fees += blob.da_storage_gas_price * blob.blob_size
        # Compute the execution gas of this operation as defined
        # in the gas cost determination specification.
        execution_fees += execution_gas(op) * mantle_tx.execution_gas_price
    return execution_fees + da_storage_fees + permanent_storage_fees
```

### MantleTx Validation

Given:

```python
signed_tx = SignedMantleTx(
    tx=MantleTx(ops, permanent_storage_gas_price, execution_gas_price, ledger_tx),
    op_proofs,
    ledger_tx_proof
)
```

Mantle validators will ensure the following:

1. The ledger transaction is valid according to [Ledger Validation](#ledger-validation).

```python
validate_ledger_tx(ledger_tx, ledger_tx_proof, mantle_txhash(tx))
```

1. There is a proof or a `None` value for each operation.

```python
assert len(op_proofs) == len(ops)
```

1. Each Operation is valid.

```python
for op, op_proof in zip(ops, op_proofs):
    assert op.opcode in MANTLE_OPCODES
    validate_mantle_op(mantle_txhash(tx), op.opcode, op.payload, op_proof)

def validate_mantle_op(txhash, opcode, payload, op_proof):
    if opcode == INSCRIBE:
        validate_inscribe(txhash, payload, op_proof)
    # elif opcode == ...
    # ...
```

1. The Mantle Transaction excess balance pays for the transaction fees.

```python
tx_fee = get_fees(signed_tx)
assert tx_fee == get_transaction_balance(signed_tx)

def get_transaction_balance(signed_tx):
    balance = 0
    for op in signed_tx.tx.ops:
        if op.opcode == LEADER_CLAIM:
            balance += get_leader_reward()
    for inp in signed_tx.tx.ledger_tx.inputs:
        balance += get_value_from_note_id(inp)
    for out in signed_tx.tx.ledger_tx.outputs:
        balance -= out.value
```

### MantleTx Execution

Given:

```python
SignedMantleTx(
    tx=MantleTx(ops, permanent_storage_gas_price, execution_gas_price, ledger_tx),
    op_proofs,
    ledger_tx_proof
)
```

Mantle Validators execute the following:

1. Execute the Ledger Transaction as described in [Ledger Validation](#ledger-validation).

1. Execute sequentially each Operation in `ops` according to its opcode.

## Mantle Operations

### Opcodes

| Operation | Opcode | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| CHANNEL_INSCRIBE | 0x00 | Write a message permanently onto Mantle. |
| CHANNEL_BLOB | 0x01 | Store a blob in DA. |
| CHANNEL_SET_KEYS | 0x02 | Manage the list of keys accredited to post to a channel. |
| RESERVED | 0x03 - 0x1F | |
| SDP_DECLARE | 0x20 | Declare intention to participate as a node in a Nomos Service, locking funds as collateral. |
| SDP_WITHDRAW | 0x21 | Withdraw participation from a Nomos Service, unlocking your funds in the process. |
| SDP_ACTIVE | 0x22 | Signal that you are still an active participant of a Nomos Service. |
| RESERVED | 0x23 - 0x2F | |
| LEADER_CLAIM | 0x30 | Claim leader reward anonymously. |
| RESERVED | 0x31 - 0xFF | |

Full nodes will track and process every Operation.
In contrast,
nodes focused on a specific rollup will also track all Operations
but will only fully process blobs that target their own rollup
referenced by a channel ID.

## Channel Operations

Channels allow Rollups to post their updates on chain.
Channels form virtual chains that overlay on top of the Cryptarchia blockchain.
Clients and dependents of Rollups can watch the Rollups channels
to learn the state of that Rollup.

### Channel Sequencing

These channels form virtual chains
by having each message reference its parent message.
The order of messages in these channels is enforced by the sequencer
by building a hash chain of messages,
i.e. new messages reference the previous messages through a parent hash.
Given that Cryptarchia has long finality times,
these message parent references allow the Rollup sequencers
to continue to post new updates to channels without having to wait for finality.
No matter how Cryptarchia forks and reorgs,
the channel messages will eventually be re-included
in a way that satisfies the virtual chain order.

The first time a message is sent to an unclaimed channel,
the message signing key that signs the initial message
becomes both the administrator and an accredited key.
The administrator can update the list of accredited keys
who are authorized to write messages to that channel.

Validators must keep the following state for processing channel Operations:

```python
channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]

class ChannelState:
    tip: hash
    accredited_keys: list[Ed25519PublicKey]
```

### CHANNEL_INSCRIBE

Write a message to a channel
with the message data being permanently stored on the Nomos blockchain.

#### CHANNEL_INSCRIBE Payload

```python
class Inscribe:
    channel: ChannelID  # Channel being written to
    inscription: bytes  # Message to be written on the blockchain
    parent: hash  # Previous message in the channel
    signer: Ed25519PublicKey  # Identity of message sender
```

#### CHANNEL_INSCRIBE Proof

```text
Ed25519Signature
```

A signature from `signer` over the Mantle txhash containing this inscription.

#### CHANNEL_INSCRIBE Execution Gas

Channel Inscribe Operations have a fixed Execution Gas cost of
`EXECUTION_CHANNEL_INSCRIBE_GAS`.
See [NOMOS-GAS-COST-DETERMINATION][gas-cost] for the Execution Gas values.

#### CHANNEL_INSCRIBE Validation

Given:

```python
txhash: zkhash
msg: Inscribe
sig: Ed25519Signature
channels: dict[ChannelID, ChannelState]
```

Validate:

```python
# Ensure the msg signer signature
assert Ed25519_verify(msg.signer, txhash, sig)

if msg.channel in channels:
    chan = channels[msg.channel]
    # Ensure signer is authorized to write to the channel
    assert msg.signer is in chan.accredited_keys
    # Ensure message is continuing the channel sequence
    assert msg.parent == chan.tip
else:
    # Channel will be created automatically upon execution
    # Ensure that this message is the genesis message (parent==ZERO)
    assert msg.parent == ZERO
```

#### CHANNEL_INSCRIBE Execution

Given:

```python
msg: Inscribe
sig: Ed25519Signature
channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]
```

Execute:

1. If the channel does not exist, create it just-in-time.

```python
if msg.channel is not in channels:
    channels[msg.channel] = ChannelState(
        tip=ZERO,
        accredited_keys=[msg.signer]
    )
```

1. Update the channel tip.

```python
chan = channels[msg.channel]
chan.tip = hash(encode(msg))
```

#### CHANNEL_INSCRIBE Example

Sending a greeting to all followers of Sovereign Rollup Earth.

```python
# Build the inscription
greeting = Inscription(
    channel=CHANNEL_EARTH,
    inscription=b"Live long and prosper",
    parent=ZERO,
    signer=spock_pk
)

# Wrap it in a transaction
tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=INSCRIBE, payload=encode(greeting))],
    permanent_storage_gas_price=150,
    execution_gas_price=70,
    ledger_tx=LedgerTx(inputs=[<spocks_note_id>], outputs=[<change_note>]),
)

# Sign the transaction
signed_tx = SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    op_proofs=[Ed25519_sign(mantle_txhash(tx), spock_sk)],
    ledger_tx_proof=tx.ledger_tx.prove(spock_sk)
)

# Send the transaction to the mempool
mempool.push(signed_tx)
```

### CHANNEL_BLOB

Write a message to a channel
where the message data is stored temporarily in NomosDA.
Data stored in NomosDA will eventually expire
but its commitment (BlobID) remains permanently on chain.
Anyone with access to the original data
can confirm that it matches this commitment.

#### CHANNEL_BLOB Payload

```python
class Blob:
    channel: ChannelID  # Channel this message is written to
    session: SessionNumber  # Session during which dispersal happened
    blob: BlobID  # Blob commitment
    blob_size: int  # Size of blob before encoding in bytes
    da_storage_gas_price: int  # 8 bytes
    parent: hash  # Previous message written to the channel
    signer: Ed25519PublicKey  # Identity of the message sender
```

`blob_size` is reported here to ensure the DA Storage fee
of this transaction can still be calculated after the Blob is expired from NomosDA.

#### CHANNEL_BLOB Proof

```text
Ed25519Signature
```

A signature from `signer` over the Mantle txhash containing this blob.

#### CHANNEL_BLOB Execution Gas

The Execution Gas consumed by a Blob Operation
is proportional to the size of the sample verified by the nodes.
The bigger the sample, the harder it is to verify it.
The size of this sample is:

```python
NUMBER_OF_DA_COLUMNS = 1024  # before RS encoding
ELEMENT_SIZE = 31  # in bytes
SAMPLE_SIZE = blob_size / (NUMBER_OF_DA_COLUMNS * ELEMENT_SIZE)
```

Channel Blob Operations have an Execution Gas cost proportional to the blob size:

```text
EXECUTION_CHANNEL_BLOB_BASE_GAS + EXECUTION_CHANNEL_BLOB_SIZED_GAS * SAMPLE_SIZE
```

See [NOMOS-GAS-COST-DETERMINATION][gas-cost] for the Execution Gas values.

#### CHANNEL_BLOB DA Storage Gas

Channel Blob Operations have a DA Storage Gas consumption proportional to Blob size:

```python
CHANNEL_BLOB_DA_STORAGE_GAS = blob_size * da_storage_gas_price
```

#### CHANNEL_BLOB Validation

Validators will perform DA sampling to ensure availability.
From these samples,
the Blob size can be determined and checked against
what is written in the Blob payload.

Given:

```python
txhash: zkhash
msg: Blob
sig: Ed25519Signature
block_slot: int
channels: dict[ChannelID, ChannelState]
```

Validate:

```python
# Verify the msg signature
assert Ed25519_verify(msg.signer, txhash, sig)

if msg.channel in channels:
    chan = channels[msg.channel]
    # Ensure signer is authorized to write to the channel
    assert msg.signer is in chan.accredited_keys
    # Ensure message is continuing the channel sequence
    assert msg.parent == chan.tip
else:
    # Channel will be created automatically upon execution
    # Ensure that this message is the Genesis message
    assert msg.parent == ZERO

if NomosDA.should_validate_block_availability(block_slot):
    # Validate Blobs that are still held in DA
    assert NomosDA.validate_availability(msg.session, msg.blob)
    # Derive Blob size from DA sample
    actual_blob_size = NomosDA.derive_blob_size(msg.blob)
    assert msg.blob_size == actual_blob_size
```

#### CHANNEL_BLOB Execution

Given:

```python
msg: Blob
sig: Ed25519Signature
channels: dict[ChannelId, ChannelState]
```

Execute:

```python
# If the channel does not exist, create it JIT
if msg.channel is not in channels:
    channels[msg.channel] = ChannelState(
        tip=ZERO,
        accredited_keys=[msg.signer]
    )

chan = channels[msg.channel]
chan.tip = hash(encode(msg))
```

#### CHANNEL_BLOB Example

Suppose a sequencer for Rollup A wants to post a Rollup update.
They would first build the `Blob` payload:

```python
# Given a rollup update and the previous txhash
rollup_update: bytes = encode([tx1, tx2, tx3])
last_channel_msg_hash: hash

# The sequencer encodes the rollup update and builds the blob payload
blob_id, blob_size = NomosDA.upload_blob(rollup_update)

msg = Blob(
    channel=ROLLUP_A,
    current_session=current_session,
    blob=blob_id,
    blob_size=blob_size,
    da_storage_gas_price=10,
    parent=last_channel_msg_hash,
    signer=sequencer_pk,
)

tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=BLOB, payload=encode(msg))],
    permanent_storage_gas_price=150,
    execution_gas_price=70,
    ledger_tx=LedgerTx(inputs=[sequencer_funds], outputs=[<change_note>])
)

signed_tx = SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    op_proofs=[sequencer_sk.sign(mantle_txhash(tx))],
    ledger_tx_proof=[tx.ledger_tx.prove(sequencer_sk)]
)
```

The Signed Mantle Transaction is then sent to DA nodes for dispersal
and added to the mempool for inclusion in a block
(see [NOMOS-DA-DISPERSAL][nomos-da]).

### CHANNEL_SET_KEYS

Overwrite the list of accredited keys to post Blobs to a channel.

#### CHANNEL_SET_KEYS Payload

```python
class ChannelSetKeys:
    channel: ChannelID
    keys: list[Ed25519PublicKey]
```

#### CHANNEL_SET_KEYS Proof

```python
Ed25519Signature  # signature from `administrator` over the Mantle tx hash.
```

#### CHANNEL_SET_KEYS Execution Gas

Channel Set Keys Operations have a fixed Execution Gas cost of
`EXECUTION_CHANNEL_SET_KEYS`.
See [NOMOS-GAS-COST-DETERMINATION][gas-cost] for the Execution Gas values.

#### CHANNEL_SET_KEYS Validation

Given:

```python
txhash: zkhash
setkeys: ChannelSetKeys
sig: Ed25519Signature
channels: dict[ChannelID, ChannelState]
```

Validate:

```python
# Ensure at least one key
assert len(setkeys.keys) > 0

if setkeys.channel in channels:
    chan = channels[setkeys.channel]
    admin_pk = chan.accredited_keys[0]
    assert Ed25519_verify(txhash, admin_pk, sig)
```

The first key of the list is the administration key.

#### CHANNEL_SET_KEYS Execution

Given:

```python
setkeys: ChannelSetKeys
channels: dict[ChannelID, ChannelState]
```

Execute:

```python
# Create the channel if it does not exist
if setkeys.channel not in channels:
    channels[setkeys.channel] = ChannelState(
        tip=CHANNEL_GENESIS,
        accredited_keys=[],
    )

# Update the set of accredited keys
channels[setkeys.channel].accredited_keys = setkeys.keys
```

#### CHANNEL_SET_KEYS Example

Suppose the administrator of Rollup A wants to add a key
to the list of accredited keys:

```python
# Given a key to add
sequencer_pk: Ed25519PublicKey

# The administrator encodes the update and builds the payload
setkeys = ChannelSetKeys(
    channel=ROLLUP_A,
    keys=[admin_pk, sequencer_pk],
)

tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=CHANNEL_SET_KEYS, payload=encode(setkeys))],
    permanent_storage_gas_price=150,
    execution_gas_price=70,
    ledger_tx=LedgerTx(inputs=[admin_funds], outputs=[<change note>])
)

signed_tx = SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    op_proofs=[Ed25519_sign(mantle_txhash(tx), admin_sk)],
    ledger_tx_proof=tx.ledger_tx.prove(admin_sk),
)
```

## Service Declaration Protocol (SDP) Operations

These Operations implement the [NOMOS-SERVICE-DECLARATION-PROTOCOL][sdp].

Validators must keep the following state when implementing SDP Operations:

```python
locked_notes: dict[NoteID, LockedNote]
declarations: dict[DeclarationID, DeclarationInfo]

class LockedNote:
    declarations: set[DeclarationID]
    locked_until: BlockNumber
```

### Common SDP Structures

```python
class ServiceType(Enum):
    BN="BN"  # Blend Network
    DA="DA"  # Data Availability

class Locator(str):
    def validate(self):
        assert len(self) <= 329
        assert validate_multiaddr(self)

class MinStake:
    stake_threshold: int  # stake value
    timestamp: int  # block number

class ServiceParameters:
    lock_period: int  # number of blocks
    inactivity_period: int  # number of blocks
    retention_period: int  # number of blocks
    timestamp: int  # block number

class DeclarationInfo:
    service: ServiceType
    locators: list[Locator]
    provider_id: Ed25519PublicKey
    zk_id: ZkPublicKey
    locked_note_id: NoteId
    created: BlockNumber
    active: BlockNumber
    withdrawn: BlockNumber
    # SDP ops updating a declaration must use monotonically increasing nonces
    nonce: int
```

### SDP_DECLARE

The service registration follows the definition given in
[NOMOS-SERVICE-DECLARATION-PROTOCOL - Declaration Message][sdp-declare].

#### SDP_DECLARE Payload

```python
class DeclarationMessage:
    service_type: ServiceType
    locators: list[Locator]
    provider_id: Ed25519PublicKey
    zk_id: ZkPublicKey
    locked_note_id: NoteId
```

Locked notes are introduced in [Locked notes](#locked-notes) and serve as Service collaterals.
They cannot be spent before the owner withdraws its participation
from the declared service(s).

#### SDP_DECLARE Proof

```python
class DeclarationProof:
    zk_sig: ZkSignature  # signature proving ownership over locked note and zk_id
    provider_sig: Ed25519Signature  # signature proving ownership of provider key
```

See [NOMOS-COMMON-CRYPTOGRAPHIC-COMPONENTS][common-crypto] for the Zero Knowledge Signature Scheme (ZkSignature).

#### SDP_DECLARE Execution Gas

SDP Declare Operations have a fixed Execution Gas cost of
`EXECUTION_SDP_DECLARE_GAS`.
See [NOMOS-GAS-COST-DETERMINATION][gas-cost] for the Execution Gas values.

#### SDP_DECLARE Validation

Given:

```python
txhash: zkhash  # the txhash of the transaction being validated
declaration: DeclarationMessage  # the declaration being validated
proof: DeclarationProof
min_stake: MinStake  # the (global) minimum stake setting
ledger: Ledger  # the set of unspent notes
locked_notes: dict[NoteId, LockedNote]
declarations: dict[NoteId, DeclarationInfo]
```

Validate:

The declaration is verified according to
[NOMOS-SERVICE-DECLARATION-PROTOCOL - Declare][sdp-declare].

1. Ensure ownership over the locked note, `zk_id` and `provider_id`.

```python
assert ZkSignature_verify(
    txhash,
    proof.zk_sig,
    [note.public_key, declaration.zk_id]
)
assert Ed25519_verify(txhash, proof.provider_sig, provider_id)
```

1. Ensure declaration does not already exist.

```python
assert declaration_id(declaration) not in declarations
```

1. Ensure it has no more than 8 locators.

```python
assert len(declaration.locators) <= 8
```

1. Ensure locked note exists and value of locked note is sufficient for joining the service.

```python
assert ledger.is_unspent(declaration.locked_note_id)
note = ledger.get_note(declaration.locked_note_id)
assert note.value >= min_stake.stake_threshold
```

1. Ensure the note has not already been locked for this service.

```python
if declaration.locked_note in locked_notes:
    locked_note = locked_notes[declaration.locked_note]
    services = [declarations[declare_id] for declare_id in locked_note.declarations]
    assert declaration.service_type not in services
```

#### SDP_DECLARE Execution

Given:

```python
declaration: DeclarationMessage  # the declaration being executed
service_parameters: dict[ServiceType, ServiceParameters]
current_block_height: int
locked_notes: dict[NoteId, LockedNote]
```

Execute:

1. Create the locked note state if it doesn't already exist.

```python
if declaration.locked_note not in locked_notes:
    locked_notes[declaration.locked_note_id] = \
        LockedNote(declarations=set(), locked_until=0)

locked_note = locked_notes[declaration.locked_note_id]
```

1. Update the locked notes timeout using this services lock period.

```python
lock_period = service_parameters[declaration.service_type].lock_period
service_lock = current_block_height + lock_period
locked_note.locked_until = max(service_lock, locked_note.locked_until)
```

1. Add this declaration to the locked note.

```python
declare_id = declaration_id(declaration)
locked_note.declarations.add(declare_id)
```

1. Store the declaration as explained in
[NOMOS-SERVICE-DECLARATION-PROTOCOL - Declaration Storage][sdp-storage].

```python
declarations[declare_id] = DeclarationInfo(
    service: declaration.service,
    locators: declaration.locators,
    provider_id: declaration.provider_id,
    zk_id: declaration.zk_id,
    locked_note_id: declaration.locked_note_id,
    created=current_block_height,
    active=current_block_height,
    withdrawn=0,
    nonce=0
)
```

Notice that locked notes **cannot** refresh their keys
to update their slot secrets required for Proof of Leadership participation
(see [NOMOS-PROOF-OF-LEADERSHIP - Protection Against Adaptive Adversaries][pol-adversaries]).
It's recommended to refresh the note before locking it,
which guarantees a key life of more than a year.
After this period,
the note cannot be used in PoL until its private key is refreshed
(see leader key setup).

#### SDP_DECLARE Example

```python
# Assume `alice_note` is in the ledger:
alice_note = Utxo(
    txhash=0x2948904F2F0F479B8F8197694B30184B0D2ED1C1CD2A1EC0FB85D299A,
    output_number=3,
    note=Note(value=500, public_key=alice_pk_1),
)

# Alice wishes to lock it to join the DA network
declaration = DeclarationMessage(
    service_type=ServiceType.DA,
    locators=["/ip4/203.0.113.10/tcp/4001"],
    provider_id=alice_provider_pk,
    zk_id=alice_pk_2,

    ledger_tx_proof=LedgerTxProof,
    op_proofs=[declaration_proof],
    ledger_proof=prove_ledger_tx(tx.ledger_tx, [alice_sk_1]),
)
```

    nonce: int
```

#### SDP_WITHDRAW Proof

A signature from the `zk_id` and the locked note `pk` attached to the declaration
is required for withdrawing from a service,
(see [NOMOS-COMMON-CRYPTOGRAPHIC-COMPONENTS][common-crypto]).

```text
ZkSignature
```

#### SDP_WITHDRAW Execution Gas

SDP Withdraw Operations have a fixed Execution Gas cost of
`EXECUTION_SDP_WITHDRAW_GAS`.

```

1. Validate SDP withdrawal according to
[NOMOS-SERVICE-DECLARATION-PROTOCOL - Withdraw][sdp-withdraw].

a. Ensure declaration exists.

```python
assert withdraw.declaration in declarations
declare_info = declarations[withdraw.declaration]
```

b. Ensure locked note `pk` and `zk_id` attached to this declaration authorized this Operation.

```python
locked_note = ledger[withdraw.locked_note_id]
assert ZkSignature_verify(txhash, signature, [locked_note.pk, declare_info.zk_id])
```

c. Ensure the declaration has not already been withdrawn.

[NOMOS-SERVICE-DECLARATION-PROTOCOL - Withdraw][sdp-withdraw].

1. Update declaration info with nonce and withdrawn timestamp.

```python
declare_info = declarations[withdraw.declaration]
declare_info.nonce = withdraw.nonce
declare_info.withdrawn = block_height
```

1. Remove this declaration from the locked note.

```python
locked_note = locked_notes[withdraw.locked_note_id]
locked_note.declarations.remove(withdraw.declaration)
```

1. Remove the locked note if it is no longer bound to any declarations.

```python
if len(locked_note.declarations) == 0:
    del locked_notes[withdraw.locked_note_id]
```

#### SDP_WITHDRAW Example

```python
withdraw = Withdraw(
    declaration=alice_declaration_id,
    locked_note_id=alices_locked_note_id,
    nonce=1579532
)

    permanent_storage_gas_price=150,
    execution_gas_price=70,
    ledger_tx=LedgerTx(
        inputs=[alices_locked_note_id],

    # proof ownership of the withdrawn note and zk id
    op_proofs=[ZkSignature_sign([alice_note_sk, alice_sk], mantle_txhash(tx))]
)
```

assert ZkSignature_verify(txhash, signature, declaration_info.zk_id)
```

#### SDP_ACTIVE Execution

Executes the active protocol
[NOMOS-SERVICE-DECLARATION-PROTOCOL - Active][sdp-active].
The activation,
i.e. setting the `declaration.active`,
is handled by the service-specific logic.

#### SDP_ACTIVE Example

```python
active = Active(
    declaration=alice_declaration_id,
    nonce=1579532,
    metadata=b"Look, I am still doing my job"
)

```

## Leader Operations

### LEADER_CLAIM

This Operation claims the leader's block reward anonymously.

#### LEADER_CLAIM Payload

```python
class ClaimRequest:
    rewards_root: zkhash  # Merkle root used in the proof for voucher membership
    voucher_nf: zkhash
```

#### LEADER_CLAIM Proof

The provider proves that they have won a proof of Leadership
before the start of the current epoch,
i.e., their reward voucher is indeed in the voucher set.

#### LEADER_CLAIM Execution Gas

Leader Claim Operations have a fixed Execution Gas cost of
`EXECUTION_LEADER_CLAIM_GAS`.
See [NOMOS-GAS-COST-DETERMINATION][gas-cost] for the Execution Gas values.

#### LEADER_CLAIM Validation

# Given
mantle_txhash: zkhash
claim: ClaimRequest
last_voucher_root: zkhash  # The last root of the voucher Merkle tree at the start of the epoch
voucher_nullifier_set: set[zkhash]
proof: ProofOfClaim

# Validate
assert claim.voucher_nf not in voucher_nullifier_set
assert claim.rewards_root == last_voucher_root
validate_proof(claim, proof, mantle_txhash)
```

#### LEADER_CLAIM Execution

1. Add `claim.voucher_nf` to the `voucher_nullifier_set`.

1. Increase the balance of the Mantle Transaction by the leader reward amount
according to [NOMOS-ANONYMOUS-LEADERS-REWARD-PROTOCOL - Leaders Reward][leaders-reward].

1. Reduce the leader's reward `leaders_rewards` value by the same amount
(without ZK proof).

#### LEADER_CLAIM Example

```python
secret_voucher = 0xDEADBEAF
reward_voucher = leader_claim_voucher(secret_voucher)
voucher_nullifier = leader_claim_nullifier(secret_voucher)

claim = ClaimRequest(
    rewards_root=REWARDS_MERKLE_TREE.root(),
    voucher_nf=voucher_nullifier,
)

tx = MantleTx(
    ops=[Op(opcode=LEADER_CLAIM, payload=encode(claim))],
    permanent_storage_gas_price=150,
    execution_gas_price=70,
    ledger_tx=LedgerTx(inputs=[<fee_note>], outputs=[<change_note>]),
)

claim_proof = claim.prove(
    secret_voucher,
    REWARDS_MERKLE_TREE.path(leaf=reward_voucher),
    mantle_txhash(tx)
)

SignedMantleTx(
    tx=tx,
    ledger_tx_proof=tx.ledger_tx.prove(fee_note_sk),
    op_proofs=[claim_proof]
)
```

## Mantle Ledger

### Notes

Notes are composed of two fields representing their value and their owner:

```python
class Note:
    value: int  # 8 bytes
    public_key: ZkPublicKey  # 32 bytes
```

### Note Id

Any note can be uniquely identified
by the Ledger Transaction that created it and its output number:
`(txhash, output_number)`.
However,
it is often useful to have a commitment to the note fields
for use in ZK proofs (e.g., for PoL),
so the note is included in the note identifier derivation.

```python
def derive_note_id(txhash: zkhash, output_number: int, note: Note) -> NoteId:
    return zkhash(
        FiniteField(b"NOMOS_NOTE_ID_V1", byte_order="little", modulus=p),
        txhash,
        FiniteField(output_number, byte_order="little", modulus=p),
        FiniteField(note.value, byte_order="little", modulus=p),
        note.public_key
    )
```

These note identifiers uniquely define notes in the system
and cannot be chosen by the user.
Nodes maintain the set of notes through a dictionary
mapping the NoteId to the note.

### Locked notes

Locked notes are special notes in Mantle
that serve as collateral for Service Declarations.
A note can become locked after executing a Declare Operation,
preventing it from being spent until explicitly released
through a Withdraw Operation.
The system maintains a mapping of locked note IDs to their supporting declarations.
Though locked,
these notes remain in the Ledger
and can still participate in Proof of Stake.
When service providers withdraw all their declarations,
the associated note(s) become unlocked and available for spending again.

### Ledger Transactions

Transactions must prove the ownership of spent notes.
In classical blockchains, this is done through a signature.
To stay compatible with this architecture,
the signature is done by a ZK proof
(see [NOMOS-COMMON-CRYPTOGRAPHIC-COMPONENTS][common-crypto]),
proving the knowledge of the secret key associated with the public key.

Transactions allow complete transaction linkability
and the public key spending the note is not hidden.

#### LedgerTx Structure

```python
class LedgerTx:
    inputs: list[NoteId]  # the list of consumed note identifiers
    outputs: list[Note]
```

#### LedgerTx Proof

A transaction proves the ownership of the consumed notes
using a Zero Knowledge Signature Scheme (ZkSignature).

```text
ZkSignature
```

ZkSignature proving ownership over the input notes
and signing the Mantle Transaction containing this Ledger Transaction.

#### LedgerTx Execution Gas

Ledger Transactions have a fixed Execution Gas cost of
`EXECUTION_LEDGER_TX_GAS`.
See [NOMOS-GAS-COST-DETERMINATION][gas-cost] for the Execution Gas values.

#### LedgerTx Hash

```python
def ledger_txhash(tx: LedgerTx) -> ZkHash:
    tx_bytes = encode(tx)
    h = Hasher()
    h.update(FiniteField(b"NOMOS_LEDGER_TXHASH_V1", byte_order="little", modulus=p))
    for i in range((len(tx_bytes)+30)//31):
        chunk = tx_bytes[i*31:(i+1)*31]
        fr = FiniteField(chunk, byte_order="little", modulus=p)
        h.update(fr)
    return h.digest()
```

### Ledger Validation

Given:

```python
mantle_txhash: ZkHash  # ZkHash of mantle tx containing this ledger tx
ledger_tx: LedgerTx
ledger_tx_proof: ZkSignature
ledger: Ledger
locked_notes: dict[NoteId, LockedNote]
```

Validate:

1. Ensure all inputs are unspent.

```python
assert all(ledger.is_unspent(note_id) for note_id in ledger_tx.inputs)
```

1. Validate ledger proof to show ownership over input notes.

```python
input_notes = [ledger[input_note_id] for input_note_id in ledger_tx.inputs]
input_pks = [note.public_key for note in input_notes]
assert ZkSignature_verify(mantle_txhash, ledger_tx_proof, input_pks)
```

1. Ensure inputs are not locked.

```python
# Ensure inputs are not locked
for note_id in ledger_tx.inputs:
    assert note_id not in locked_notes
```

1. Ensure outputs are valid.

```python
for output in ledger_tx.outputs:
    assert output.value > 0
    assert output.value < 2**64
```

### Ledger Execution

Given:

```python
ledger_tx: LedgerTx
ledger_tx_proof: ZkSignature
ledger: Ledger
```

Execute:

1. Remove inputs from the ledger.

```python
for note_id in ledger_tx.inputs:
    # updates the merkle tree to zero out the leaf for this entry
    # and adds that leaf index to the list of unused leaves
    ledger.remove(note_id)
```

1. Add outputs to the ledger.

```python
txhash = ledger_txhash(ledger_tx)
for (output_number, output_note) in enumerate(tx.outputs):
    output_note_id = derive_note_id(txhash, output_number, output_note)
    ledger.add(output_note_id)
```

### Ledger Example

```python
alice_note_id = ...  # assume Alice holds a note worth 501 NMO
bob_note = Note(
    value=500,
    public_key=bob_pk,
)

ledger_tx = LedgerTx(
    inputs=[alice_note_id],
    outputs=[bob_note],
)
```

## Appendix

### Gas Determination

From [NOMOS-GAS-COST-DETERMINATION][gas-cost],
the following gas values are used:

| Variable | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| EXECUTION_LEDGER_TX_GAS | 590 |
| EXECUTION_CHANNEL_INSCRIBE_GAS | 56 |
| EXECUTION_CHANNEL_BLOB_BASE_GAS | 6356 |
| EXECUTION_CHANNEL_BLOB_SIZED_GAS | 1600 |
| EXECUTION_CHANNEL_SET_KEYS | 56 |
| EXECUTION_SDP_DECLARE_GAS | 646 |
| EXECUTION_SDP_WITHDRAW_GAS | 590 |
| EXECUTION_SDP_ACTIVE_GAS | 590 |
| EXECUTION_LEADER_CLAIM_GAS | 580 |

### Zero Knowledge Signature Scheme (ZkSignature)

A proof attesting that for the following public values:

```python
class ZkSignaturePublic:
    public_keys: list[ZkPublicKey]  # public keys signing the message (len = 32)
    msg: zkhash  # zkhash of the message
```

The prover knows a witness:

```python
class ZkSignatureWitness:
    # The list of secret keys used to sign the message
    secret_keys: list[ZkSecretKey]  # (len = 32)
```

Such that the following constraints hold:

- The number of secret keys is equal to the number of public keys.

```python
assert len(secret_keys) == len(public_keys)
```

- Each public key is derived from the corresponding secret key.

```python
assert all(
    notes[i].public_key == zkhash(
        FiniteField(b"NOMOS_KDF", byte_order="little", modulus=p),
        secret_keys[i])
    for i in range(len(public_keys))
)
```

- The proof is bound to `msg` (the `mantle_tx_hash` in case of transactions).

> For implementation,
> the ZkSignature circuit will take a maximum of 32 public keys as inputs.
> To prove ownership of fewer keys,
> the remaining inputs will be padded with the public key
> corresponding to the secret key 0 and ignored during execution.
> The outputs have no size limit
> since they are included in the hashed message.

### Proof of Claim

A proof attesting that given these public values:

```python
class ProofOfClaimPublic:
    voucher_root: zkhash  # Merkle root of the reward_voucher maintained by everyone
    voucher_nullifier: zkhash
    mantle_tx_hash: zkhash  # attached hash
```

The prover knows the following witness:

```python
class ProofOfClaimWitness:
    secret_voucher: zkhash
    voucher_merkle_path: list[zkhash]
    voucher_merkle_path_selectors: list[bool]
```

Such that the following constraints hold:

- The reward voucher is derived from the secret voucher.

```python
assert reward_voucher == zkhash(
    FiniteField(b"REWARD_VOUCHER", byte_order="little", modulus=p),
    secret_voucher)
```

- There exists a valid Merkle path from the reward voucher as a leaf to the Merkle root.

```python
assert voucher_root == path_root(
    leaf=reward_voucher,
    path=voucher_merkle_path,
    selectors=voucher_merkle_path_selectors)
```

- The voucher nullifier is derived from the secret voucher correctly.

```python
assert voucher_nullifier == zkhash(
    FiniteField(b"VOUCHER_NF", byte_order="little", modulus=p),
    secret_voucher)
```

- The proof is bound to the `mantle_tx_hash`.

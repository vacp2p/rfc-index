## Abstract

This specification defines the hardware requirements for running various types of Nomos blockchain nodes. Hardware needs vary significantly based on the node's role, from lightweight verification nodes to high-performance Zone Executors. The requirements are designed to support diverse participation levels while ensuring network security and performance.

## Motivation

The Nomos network is designed to be inclusive and accessible across a wide range of hardware configurations. By defining clear hardware requirements for different node types, we enable:

1. **Inclusive Participation**: Allow users with limited resources to participate as Light Nodes
2. **Scalable Infrastructure**: Support varying levels of network participation based on available resources
3. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure adequate resources for computationally intensive operations
4. **Network Security**: Maintain network integrity through properly resourced validator nodes
5. **Service Quality**: Define requirements for optional services that enhance network functionality

**Important Notice**: These hardware requirements are preliminary and subject to revision based on implementation testing and real-world network performance data.

## Specification

### Node Types Overview

Hardware requirements vary based on the node's role and services:

- **Light Node**: Minimal verification with minimal resources
- **Basic Bedrock Node**: Standard validation participation
- **Service Nodes**: Enhanced capabilities for optional network services

### Light Node

Light Nodes provide network verification with minimal resource requirements, suitable for resource-constrained environments.

**Target Use Cases:**

- Mobile devices and smartphones
- Single-board computers (Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- IoT devices with network connectivity
- Users with limited hardware resources

**Hardware Requirements:**

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **CPU** | Low-power processor (smartphone/SBC capable) |
| **Memory (RAM)** | 512 MB |
| **Storage** | Minimal (few GB) |
| **Network** | Reliable connection, 1 Mbps free bandwidth |

### Basic Bedrock Node (Validator)

Basic validators participate in Bedrock consensus using typical consumer hardware.

**Target Use Cases:**

- Individual validators on consumer hardware
- Small-scale validation operations
- Entry-level network participation

**Hardware Requirements:**

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **CPU** | 2 cores, 2 GHz modern multi-core processor |
| **Memory (RAM)** | 1 GB minimum |
| **Storage** | SSD with 100+ GB free space, expandable |
| **Network** | Reliable connection, 1 Mbps free bandwidth |

### Service-Specific Requirements

Nodes can optionally run additional Bedrock Services that require enhanced resources beyond basic validation.

#### Data Availability (DA) Service

DA Service nodes store and serve data shares for the network's data availability layer.

**Service Role:**

- Store blockchain data and blob data long-term
- Serve data shares to requesting nodes
- Maintain high availability for data retrieval

**Additional Requirements:**

| Component | Specification | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **CPU** | Same as Basic Bedrock Node | Standard processing needs |
| **Memory (RAM)** | Same as Basic Bedrock Node | Standard memory needs |
| **Storage** | **Fast SSD, 500+ GB free** | Long-term chain and blob storage |
| **Network** | **High bandwidth (10+ Mbps)** | Concurrent data serving |
| **Connectivity** | **Stable, accessible external IP** | Direct peer connections |

**Network Requirements:**

- Capacity to handle multiple concurrent connections
- Stable external IP address for direct peer access
- Low latency for efficient data serving

#### Blend Protocol Service

Blend Protocol nodes provide anonymous message routing capabilities.

**Service Role:**

- Route messages anonymously through the network
- Provide timing obfuscation for privacy
- Maintain multiple concurrent connections

**Additional Requirements:**

| Component | Specification | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **CPU** | Same as Basic Bedrock Node | Standard processing needs |
| **Memory (RAM)** | Same as Basic Bedrock Node | Standard memory needs |

**Network Requirements:**

- Low-latency connection for effective message blending
- Stable connection for timing obfuscation
- Capability to handle multiple simultaneous connections

#### Executor Network Service

Zone Executors perform the most computationally intensive work in the network.

**Service Role:**

- Execute Zone state transitions
- Generate zero-knowledge proofs
- Process complex computational workloads

**Critical Performance Note**: Zone Executors perform the heaviest computational work in the network. High-performance hardware is crucial for effective participation and may provide competitive advantages in execution markets.

**Hardware Requirements:**

|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **CPU** | **Very high-performance multi-core processor** | Zone logic execution and ZK proving |
| **Memory (RAM)** | **32+ GB strongly recommended** | Complex Zone execution requirements |
| **Storage** | Same as Basic Bedrock Node | Standard storage needs |
| **GPU** | **Highly recommended/often necessary** | Efficient ZK proof generation |
| **Network** | **High bandwidth (10+ Mbps)** | Data dispersal and high connection load |

**GPU Requirements:**

- **NVIDIA**: CUDA-enabled GPU (RTX 3090 or equivalent recommended)
- **Apple**: Metal-compatible Apple Silicon
- **Performance Impact**: Strong GPU significantly reduces proving time

**Network Requirements:**

- Support for **2048+ direct UDP connections** to DA Nodes (for blob publishing)
- High bandwidth for data dispersal operations
- Stable connection for continuous operation

*Note: DA Nodes utilizing [libp2p](https://docs.libp2p.io/) connections need sufficient capacity to receive and serve data shares over many connections.*

## Implementation Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

All Nomos nodes MUST meet:

1. **Basic connectivity** to the Nomos network via [libp2p](https://docs.libp2p.io/)
2. **Adequate storage** for their designated role
3. **Sufficient processing power** for their service level
4. **Reliable network connection** with appropriate bandwidth for [QUIC](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/transports/quic/) transport

### Optional Enhancements

Node operators MAY implement:

- Enhanced cooling for high-performance configurations
- Dedicated network connections for service nodes utilizing [libp2p](https://docs.libp2p.io/) protocols
- Backup power systems for continuous operation

### Resource Scaling

Requirements may vary based on:

- **Network Load**: Higher network activity increases resource demands
- **Zone Complexity**: More complex Zones require additional computational resources
- **Service Combinations**: Running multiple services simultaneously increases requirements
- **Geographic Location**: Network latency affects optimal performance requirements

## Security Considerations

### Hardware Security

1. **Secure Storage**: Use encrypted storage for sensitive node data
2. **Network Security**: Implement proper firewall configurations
